_christiane_domen_cd,"Antwerp, Belgium",Ghost town Kolmanskop 10 km drive from LÃ¼deritz,We booked a visit to Kolmanskop. You can only visit the ghost town with a guide. Eveything was perfectly organized. First you make a tour with a guide in an international group. After that there is plenty of time to explore the place on your own. Visits 10-13h. Make sure you are on time at the gate. The guides are very passionate and make the town alive again with their stories.,23-Aug-19,Friends,Epupa Falls

The contrasting colours are spectacular.To reach Deadvlei one needs a 4x4 vehicle to drive the last 5km's to the Deadvlei parking area.  If you don't have a 4x4, NWR offers a 4x4 return taxi service to the Deadvlei parking area for R150pp.  From the parking area, one has to walk about 1.5km's to Deadvlei.  Due to the heat in the desert, even in early winter, it is best to do Deadvlei during the morning - before midday.",29-May-17,Friends,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve

Despite booking this trip at the very last minute Namibia Tours were able to secure us a fantastic package with visits to amazing places and great lodges. We drove over 4,500 km in three weeks without any problems, following a wonderfully detailed and well planned itinerary along the way.

Best idea we have had in a long time.  ATS Tours and our guide (please forgive the misspelling) Auggie were wonderful.  The hotels and lodges we stayed in couldn't have been nicer, cleaner and the beds more comfortable.  The Desert Homestead Lodge in Sesreim needs A/C which i think they will have soon.  I understand the new owner is putting in solar panels.  It's so remote  that they work off generators.  This will just make it more fabulous.

We had a fantastic experience with Namibia Tours & Safaris. Janine was a pleasure to work with. She is very knowledgeable and helped craft an itinerary that was absolutely perfect for us. She was very patient and responsive as we tweaked the itinerary and addressed all our questions. We wanted to use a tour company inside Namibia and Namibia Tours & Safaris proved to be the right decision!Once we arrived in Namibia everything was seamless from the airport pickup, meet and greet and handover of the vehicle (Simone and Wayne were great), and every booking and reservation was as expected. I'd like to add that they manage their own fleet of cars and the Toyota Fortuner we drove was almost brand new.This was without any hesitation one of the best vacations we've ever had.

2043PaulL,"Erskineville, Australia",Amazing Organisation and a stunning itinerary,"We had developed an outline plan for a self drive tour of Namibia and ending up in Cape Town. Wilmari turned that outline into a great, well organised trip with expert advice on how to tweak our basic  outline to take into account driving times and the amount to see and do in each location.  She gave us a great variety of lodges from the classic african Rondeval camps to quirky Safari Tent camps that were themed along the lines of a Mad Max film set.We hired a 4WD Toyota Fortuner from NT & S as well.  the vehicle was relatively new, well maintained and comfortable for four people, though when planning luggage, remember the extra spare wheel takes up space in the luggage area - I recommend no more than 1 x 70l soft duffel bag per perosn, along with a small 'carry on' back pack.Wilmari and the team's  capabilities really showed when 3 days into our trip South Africa shut its borders as part of the global Covid-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak.  rather than rush home we decided to replan our trip, staying in Namibia rather than continuing to Cape Town.  Wilmari replanned everything and rescheduled and reconfirmed our accommodation on the new schedule  within 2 days.Then, at very short notice Namibia closed its borders, with all inbound and outbound international flights suspended and the country put into lockdown with movement highly restricted.  At short notice we had to, once again cancel the accommodation for the second half of our trip and quickly get back to Windhoek and into accommodation where we could be happy for an indeterminate period of a few weeks until we were able to get home.  Once again Wilmari excelledand found us a great one bedroom apartment in a safe and pleasent area of windhoek, where we were quite happy to sit it out... we eventually ended up leaving on Lufthansa repatriation flights back to London via Germanyits the quality of the team that really stands out in these difficult situations - Wilmari and the team really stood out and demonstrated that they can handle pretty much anything in their stride.Highly recomended",5-Apr-20,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

I'd highly recommend this place as its an experience never seen before. I don't know what it is but the red dunes and the bright blue sky.

Obviously they are old and the sand has started taking over most of the building but some of them, I was amazed by the interior for something so old.

311guillermo,"Calgary, Canada","Namibia/South Africa, trip of a lifetime - Namibia Tours and Safaris, outstanding travel agency","We just came back from a self-drive trip to southern Africa in June-July. We visited the several places in the Caprivi Strip, Etosha NP, Damaraland, Skeleton Coast and Sossusvlei (Namibia), and Cape Town and Franschhoek Valley (South Africa). The trip was organized by Namibia Tours and Safaris (NT&S), with the help of Wilmari. They also provided the 4x4 vehicle. It will be very hard to find a way to describe how well organized the trip was. NT&S suggested a wonderful itinerary, provided invaluable information, responded all my requests quickly and in detail, supplied an excellent vehicle, selected outstanding accommodations, gave us very useful advise for the trip and finally provided all necessary support during our journey.  We visited places that are unique, for their beauty and the experiences they provide. We saw the Big Five (including both Black and White Rhinos) and a very large number of mammal, reptile and bids species, and were able to appreciate their behaviour in the wild. We enjoyed the wonderful landscapes of Etosha, Damaraland and Sossusvlei (Namib Desert), among others. And at the end of the trip, we had a fantastic relaxing time in Franschhoek and Cape Town. I can honestly say that Namibia is among the best places to visit in the world. I have used a number of travel agencies in my life and I cannot say I found one better than Namibia Tours and Safaris.",17-Jul-19,Couples,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve

60stevea,"Salt Lake City, UT",Stunningly unique,"Sand dunes and dead trees can be found all around the world, but having both together in the same spot is somewhat rare. Deadvlei is the poster child for Namibian tourism, and rightly so. The uniqueness of the area, even for someone who lives in a desert environment, makes it a mandatory stop on any visit to the country. If you don't have a 4x4, or have no experience driving a vehicle in sand using 4x4, then take the shuttle. The last few km to the Deadvlei parking area can be a bit rough. I came across 4 people in 2 vehicles who got stuck. The problem they had was that their rental vehicles, while 4x4, were small car based suvs, with little ground clearance. The key to making it safely to Deadvlei is having ground clearance as some of the tire ruts can be fairly deep, which will immediately get a small suv high centered. I woke and intended to drive out for sunrise, but there were literally hundreds of other vehicles doing the same thing. Instead, we went later in the afternoon and stayed for sunset. Absolutely perfect with NO other people there and still excellent lighting for pictures. Make sure to bring lots of water along.",3-Aug-17,Couples,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve
60stevea,"Salt Lake City, UT",Not your typical ghost town,"What sets this place apart from any other ghost town I have visited is both the use of extremely solid architecture & the fact that it is slowly fading away into the sand. We arrived when the gates opened at 8:00am and had the place to ourselves for over an hour before everyone started driving in for the first tour at 9:30am. You can literally walk/crawl through all the buildings. Each room looks different with the amount of sand and the amount of light. I wouldn't say it is spooky, but post apocalyptic would probably be fitting. The tours they offer are really good and very insightful. Absolutely worth the stop if you happen to be in Luderitz.",28-Jun-17,Couples,Epupa Falls

85cann,"Atlanta, GA","South Africa, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe - Unforgettable!","This was a fantastic trip that was full of countless memorable experiences and the person who made this 20 day trip so special was Philip.  He is an incredible guide with knowledge, experience and the unique ability to relate to everyone he meets, usually with humor. We toured Namibia with him before and decided to ""expand our horizons"" this trip. He met us in Johannesburg and from there we continued on through Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia exploring many national parks, rivers, the Okavango Delta, towns, markets and even a few neat coffee shops.  I cannot forget to mention the visit to the iconic Victoria Falls. It is awesome!  Philip took us wherever we wanted to go. We were so fortunate to see endless expanses of the beautiful spring African countryside both on tarred roads and off road. I must also add that Philip is a superb driver!  As for seeing animals, there were SO many...especially the elephants.  We had the luxury of sitting in the car for long periods of time watching LOTS of them graze, take mud bathes, and enjoy the Chobe River.  So very special!  In addition to them, we saw countless hippos, cape buffalo, zebras, giraffes, fish eagles, and more. Numerous photographic opportunities! Our lodging was just as special. Philip had organized a great variety of accommodations over the 20 days, from a luxury safari tent outside of Johanessburg, to a camp in Hwange Park Zimbabwe, to a cool hut in the Chobe Safari Lodge, to bush tents in Zambia where we heard a lion roar, Every day was always a new adventure. I could go on and on about all of the wonderful things we did and saw over almost 3 weeks in Africa, but I will stop now. My experience over 2 extended  trips with Philip has truly been unforgettable.  He is the best.

She was very responsive to email. Most impressively, she organized and booked our trip on 2-3 weeks notice.Pick-upAirport pickup in Windhoek was easy. The next morning we met Estelle, who walked us through the itinerary and maps. She was instrumental in helping us decide which activities we might want to pursue in each location and which activities we were better off skipping. Wayne the fleet manager gave us a very thorough briefing of the vehicle and how to use the 4x4. He also gave us the valuable advice of reducing tire pressure on gravel/dirt roads and increasing it for the paved roads. Saved us getting a flat.VehicleWe had a Nissan Hardbody double cab 4x4. It was immaculate. Very clean, very well maintained. No problems whatsoever. This was our biggest concern, as we weren't sure how the vehicles would be in Namibia, but this was perfect. We met other tourists who had problems with poorly maintained rental vehicles from other rental companies. We're happy to say that we had no issues. While we didn't do any serious offroading, a 4x4 was essential. A smaller car with lower clearance would have presented problems on a lot of the roads, especially around Sossusvlei and in Damaraland. Also, I can't imagine doing this drive in an automatic. A car with manual transmission isnecessary.LodgingAll the hotels that NTS booked for us were fantastic. Our favorites were Camp Kipwe in Damaraland and Okonjima Bush Camp south of Etosha. A bit of advice for fellow travelers: wifi can be scarce in rural Namibia, even at luxury properties, so try not to depend on it.Overall a very professional outfit and very focused on making sure their customers have a good experience. Staff is on call 24hrs a day in case you run into any issues on the road. Namibia itself is an amazing country that is best experienced with your own car.",20-Dec-16,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp

Great lodges, though on 2 occasions they suggested we had not paid when we had - an admin issue. Lodges please note and get your act together!

It is 44km on a gravel road until you arrive at the CCF.What a magical place! The staff were incredibly welcoming and inviting and we were just in time to watch the cheetah feeding (2pm). The 'guide' was very knowledgeable and shared a lot of information about cheetahs in general, cheetahs in Namibia, the stories of the cheetah we watch being fed. She was enormously enthusiastic and clearly loves being involved in the project.We watched 9 cheetahs being fed - through a wire fence - and took photos while listening. We then walked through the education centre which looks very impressive. Again, lots of information and lots of displays relevant to all age groups from young kids to big kids like me!! There was a big school group from USA who were staying for a few days to learn more - what a special experience.Part of the CCF is breeding Anatolian dogs which are good dogs to protect the livestock herd (sheep and goats) from any predators. We were escorted to see where the dogs live, and learn a bit more about the program.We also had a light lunch, and supported the project even further by buying souvenirs.Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to take part in any other activities, but I am sure they would be very worthwhile based on what we experienced. We'll definitely be back next time we are in Namibia!It is a great project which is making a big difference in preserving cheetahs in Namibia. Very worthwhile, so if your itinerary allows, do stop past.",25-Jun-15,Couples,Desert Explores

Tanya Usys was very helpful in working with us to put together an itinerary that got to most of what we wanted to see.  (We could have used one more day.  If you're short on time, another option to consider would be small planes between different parts of the country, rather than driving.)

Please see my detailed reviews for each lodge where we stayed - in summary I would highly recommend Hoodia Desert Lodge, Camp Kipwe and Onguma Treetop, which were the standouts.Namibia Tours and Safaris were very professional and prompt in responding to emails, and their quote very competitive to others I received.

Adelaide,"Adelaide, Australia","Well worth a visit, great experience","The CCF is an education and research centre for cheetahs, and is open to the public. If you visit the CCF looking to pat, cuddle and have your picture taken with cheetahs â you will be disappointed. We gained a great insight into the research and initiatives of the CCF, and the education centre was a good learning experience. The livestock guarding dogs programme is a great step forward for the cheetahs future survival. A passionate, dedicated team, doing great work.Activities - CCF tour (all day, 2hrs N130 p/p), Cheetah Run (8am, 1/2 hr N400 p/p), Bellebeno Drive (9am or 11am, 2-3 hrs N700 p/p), Elands Drive (departs throughout day, 1hr, N400), Little Serengeti (daily only, 2-3 hrs N700 p/p), Tracking Safaris (special requests only, 2-3 hrs N1000 p/p), Food (for groups, advance booking).Booking for activities - we used reservations@exclusive.com.na. Some activities require booking in advance whilst others can be booked upon arrival. We did the Cheetah Run (at 8am) and the Elands Drive (9am). Both activities were rewarding.Facilities - small cafeteria, curio shop, clean toilet area, well maintained grounds, good education centre, car parking area.Travel - from Otjiwarongo head north on B1 towards Otavi, and turn off is just before the small bridge out of town on the right (signed from highway). Its a gravel road with dense vegetation close to road (so watch out for game, and drive to the conditions).Onward travel - we left CCF around 11.00am and made it to Etosha NP (Von Lindequist Gate) with a stop for lunch and a stop in Tsumeb (shop, alcohol, fuel) by 3pm. The B1 is tarred.Verdict â very rewarding experience. Pictures of the cheetahs was really just a bonus. We will be adding the CCF to our annual donation list!

It has been preserved for more than 100 years after the diamond mining felt the effects of the Great Depression. The great hall or ballroom is where it all starts and to imagine the rather opulent lives lead by the few living there is mind boggling- they had ice , a ballroom , baker , butcher , small train delivering a half block of ice to every house daily , 20l fresh water per day per person - all from a Luderitz condensor making fresh water from seawater.

Alan R,"Cambridge, UK",Part of the unique Sossusvlei environment,"Generally, many tourists arrive at the gate of the national park at sunrise. To get to Deadvlei, you have to drive 60km on the tarmacked road and then there is a drive through a dried up river bed to Deadvlei. Two recommendations: 1) if you are not a confident and knowledgeable 4*4 driver you may get stuck driving through the dried up rivers - an alternative is to get the shuttle from the car park at the end of the tarmacked road. 2) most tourists stop at Dune 45 on the way to Deadvlei and climb it with a huge train of other tourists  who they then go on to Deadvlei with; I would recommend driving straight past Dune 45 and visiting Deadvlei first when there will be few other visitors and then climbing Dune 45 on the way out after most of the tourists have left. Thirdly if you visit in winter, it will likely be cold first thing and so wear lots of layers that you can take off as the desert heats up.Deadvlei itself is about a 15 minute walk from the final car park and is a unique and photogenic environment. Alternatively you can climb the neighbouring dune and look down on it.",24-Aug-18,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Our concerns proved to be unfounded as we found the staff to be friendly and willing. If I do have a criticism it is that I think staff training isnât up to scratch.The waterhole is very good and we saw lots of elephants which probably precluded the visit of other animals. The food was unpretentious and good. The wine list was limited and contained no Namibian wine which should be fixed. Our rooms were clean and comfortable.

Main road was good but sand tracks thereafter........ and it was hot!The Diamond Capital of the world a hundred years ago now transformed into a slowly decaying shell gradually being consumed by sand. In its heyday it had remarkable facilities. The skittle alley and main entertainment hall have been preserved and include fascinating photos of the early days, particularly diamond smuggling attempts.We moved as a group initially from building to building marvelling at what had been achieved long ago, but the process of moving through sand and the heat made progress slow. We were lucky it was not a windy day. On some occasions it whips along at a 100 km an hour.The weakness in our tour was that too little time was allowed for personal investigations. The âtownâ was spread fairly wide and a fair bit of ploughing through sand was necessary.It had a haunting quality!",24-Apr-19,Family,Epupa Falls
AlanWardinYork,"York, UK",Very knowledgeable guide,"Namibia is a fascinating place and our guide, Buzz, was great. His passion for the country and wildlife was very infectious and made for a very memorable experience of the desert, coast and Swakopmund. It was very busy on the day we visited (3 cruise ships in port), so our tour had been sub contracted to Buzz who worked for one of the sister companies in Walvis Bay (Batis Birding safaris I think), but we in no way suffered for this. Our impression was that all the guides making pick ups at the port were very professional and friendly. In our case we had a tailored tour that avoided the crowds despite the number of visitors on that day. We saw the desert, Dune 7, the moon landscape, coast and highlights of Swakopmund in a good value full day tour. The highlight was a slow mo video of a chameleon shooting out his tongue in the desert. All in all highly recommended.",2-Feb-19,Couples,Epupa Falls
alaskantravelnut,Anchorage,Extraordinarily professional and helpful,"My wife and I, and our two adult children, rented a 4x4 truck through Namibia Tours & Safaris for a 24 day trip through Namibia, Botswana, and Vic Falls.  The truck was outfitted with two rooftop tents.  We mostly camped, but also stayed in some lodges.  Our journey included a two-night fly-in trip to a lodge in the Okavango.  Ulrike, at Namibia Tours & Travel arranged our stays and our transportation.  It was an incredible trip.We have traveled extensively.  We do not typically use agencies to make our travel arrangements.  However, this agency, and Ulrike individually, were recommended to us by well-traveled friends who had done a similar trip a few years earlier.  We had abundant e-mail correspondence with Ulrike when planning this trip.  We gave her a rough idea of the places that we wanted to visit and a general description of our budget.  She customized our trip.  She promptly responded to all of our correspondence and provided us with substantial information about our various options.  She was incredibly professional and paid a lot of attention to detail.  Our travels took us through Swakopmund where her office is located.  I stopped in to say hello.  She was as personable as she was professional.  When we arrived in Windhoek to start our trip, we were provided with a travel diary that Ulrike had prepared.  This included very helpful information about our destinations, our accomdations, and our route.  We were also provided with a pre-programmed GPS and a telephone to use in emergencies.  They arranged transportation to and from airports upon our arrival and departure.I could have planned this trip without using this agency, and likely would have saved some money doing so.  But, the trip was reasonably priced, and we certainly got our money's worth.  It was an incredible adventure.  By using Namibia Tours and Safaris, I undoubtedly saved many, many hours of research and planning that would have been required had I tried to do this without their help.  Even then, I likely would not have had as good a trip as we had by booking through Namibia Tours and Safaris.  Moreover, it was comforting to know that there was a local company available to help solve any problems that could have arisen.  I very highly recommend this company, and Ulrike in particular.",21-Nov-19,Solo,Namib-Naukluft National Park
alaskantravelnut,Anchorage,Stunning contrasts,"A drive into this park offers views of burnt orange sand dunes and occasional wildlife sightings.  Purchasing a pass into the park is good for multiple entries in the same day.  The views are better early in the morning and late in the evening, when the light is best to illuminate the stark contrasts.  It is also cooler then.  You can drive all the way to Deadvlei.  The last three kilometers are through sand, and only for confident drivers with four wheel drive.  You can also take a free shuttle from the 2 wheel drive parking lot over the last 3 km to Deadvlei and back again.  Hiking up the large dunes at the end of the road offers stunning vistas according to our fit kids.  However, you can also enjoy the views with little or moderate walking.

Alastair C,"Penarth, UK",A Truly Amazing Experience,"We decided on a self drive tour around the southern half of Namibia over a two week period using Namibia Tours and Safaris.  The vehicle was great, a Toyota Frontera 4wd with two spare tyres (thankfully not needed!) On pick up we were given a thorough briefing on driving the vehicle including the inflating and deflating guidelines as there is no roadside assistance package in Namibia although a tracker on the vehicle and a mobile phone meant the company support service was never more than a day away (remember this is Namibia) Lodges had been entered in sat nav, water cooler generously provided foc and we were off.Among the highlights were Fish River Canyon,Sossusvlei and Kolmonskop but the real highlights was the stunning and diverse scenery, wildlife,night skies,  the people we encountered and the experience of driving 100's of miles along wide dirt tracks without seeing another vehicle. This is truly a unique country and well worth the time, effort and expense to visit but it would have been a lot more challenging to do independently and with such remote and rugged destinations the support of a Tour company provides that little bit of reassuranceThe support given by the team was great and they even sorted out the shipping of a lost shirt back to the UK so I would like to thank Jenifer and all of the team for all of their advice and support with our trip.NB.2 golden nuggets of adviceEnsure you always fill up when you see a modern petrol station, some of them on the map are little more than big tanks with a hose!Check your lodge locations on a map and don't blindly trust the sat nav as we experienced a couple of issues where our sat nav had a meltdown and tried to takes us through a mountain.range !",26-Aug-18,Friends,Onguma Bush Camp

On our way from Walvis Bay to Twyfelfontein we went via C34 to Hentisbaai and then turned to C35 for Uis. By the same afternoon we stopped for overnight at the White Leady Lodge. White Leady Lodge is facilitated by the local community, there are a few basic chalets and the camp. At the main building is a swimming pool and small restaurant with the bar. Next day we continued by the C35, yet at some places turning off roads to watch birds and some wild life, eventually getting to C39 turning west for Twyfelfontein. Twyfelfontein is nicely situated lodge with well organised pool, restaurant and the bar. We slept in a chalet equipped with essentials like a TV, el.kettle and fan. Early next morning we continued by C39 towards the coats and reaching C34 turned south for Hentisbaai.

One of the two swimming pools was closed (it was grass green). There were no grass lawns near the waterhole but the ground was covered by unsightly grey pebbles. It looked as if all the prime units close to the waterhole were unoccupied during peak season. Most of the gravel roads in the Etosha Pan are in a very poor state. The main road between Halali and Namutoni was in a slighly better state but I expect it is because fewer people drive on this road.

Amdrea C,"Chevy Chase, MD",Family trip of a lifetime,"Namibia Tours and Safaris and especially my consultant Chantelle, whom I had worked with before did an awesome job arranging our South African safari for 11, including three families, one solo, and four children from 5 to 9 years of age. The planning took almost a year and Chantelle stayed with me and held my hand through the difficulty of getting the common date, the international arrangements, the local arrangements and getting the accommodations to work for us. She also hoped us to find the best venues and to integrate all the things we wanted to see and do.  The result was a varied experience from tuks tuks in Soweto to cantering in Waterburg, archery and English high tea, massage and the freedom to design your own activities at Ants Nest, to communing with lots of european families at the tented camp where buffalo and elephant roamed in Manyeleti, to the luxury of Ulusaba.  We actually saw the Big Six if one counts the  whales in Port elizabeth using the same boat as the BBC and stayed at Woodall Lodge a definite foodie destination.  The finale was Cape Town--alas the weather did not permit us to go to Robben Island which we had prebooked.  Every transfer was perfect down to the minute.  All the venues were great and there was enough variety and enough science  to entertain everyone.  The children loved it and even took home some of the issues they observed such as the need to plan for water shortages and the legacy of apartheid.",18-Sep-18,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

Andre A,"Zurich, Switzerland",Wonderful time,"We wanted to do a self-drive two week trip around Namibia, we had a rough idea of which places we wanted to visit but a lot of questions and general concerns. So at the beginning were unsure about either using a Tour Operator and which one to chose.Fortunately we had a good feedback from friends that have chosen Namibia Tours & Safaris (NTS) previously and we submitted an enquiry form on their website. From the first email and discussion with Petra, our consultant, we had a very positive feeling.Petra was an outstanding partner during the tour design process, she listened to our concerns, was quick to reply, flexible with changes and easy to reach. When absent for holidays she notified us beforehand so that we could address any questions to colleagues in case we needed.When in Namibia, NTS representative was waiting for us to do the transfer to our hotel and was very supportive. We also had the best experience with Wayne and Simone that explained us how to handle any potential issues with the car, showed us the map with our trip and explained us the route in more detail. Fortunately we did not have any issues in Namibia, it is a wonderful country, with very nice people, amazing landscapes and that we hope will continue taking care of its wildlife. We want to come back asap and we would recommend to any of our friends and family to use NTS any time. A good tour operator gives you rest of mind as you have always a contact in case of any problem and we doubt there is better for trips in Sub-Saharan Africa than NTS.Big thank you!",5-Sep-19,Couples,Dune 45

Lucky for me I found Namibia Tour and Safaris who were great to deal with. I was working with Janine and she was very helpful, very fast on email and very easy to deal with. We only had 4 full days in Namibia (not long enough!) and so we opted for a self-drive tour in a 4x4 (camping) to Sossusvlei. We arrived in the evening at Windhoek airport and were met by a Namibia Tour and Safari tour rep who took us to Urban Camp (recommend it). Next day again picked up and taken to car rental company where we met 2 staff from the Tour company who were very helpful and answered all our questions. The car rental company were also super easy to deal with (get the windscreen coverage!) and we were soon driving down corrugated dirt roads to Sossusvlei in a Toyota Hillux. We had though about changing our itinerary and the Tour staff were very encouraging about this if we had wanted to. In the end we did not as wanted to fully enjoy the dune experience (sunset and sunrise hikes up the dunes). We did get a cracked windshield from a passing truck but since we had insurance it was not and issue and calling the car rental company reassured us on this. Our first experience of a Tour company and I must say I was very impressed by just how helpful they were and their professionalism and would definitely recommend them to any traveler going to Namibia.

The accommodations were brilliant, most places included dinner so little else to pay for. We had a 4 x 4 from the company and a GPS which was invaluable. The trip we had was bespoke, so we just emailed Edward a budget and where we wanted to go and everything else was handled by him, saving a lot of hassle. We were collected from the airport, the brand new truck was waiting at the B and B, with a run through from Wayne, and we were met the next morning by Estelle, who gave us a map, vouchers, information on what to do and some insight into the culture of the country. Everywhere we stayed was top class, friendly, clean and in beautiful surroundings. We loved it so much we are going back next year.",2-Mar-15,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Phone!So what we did was the ""Eland Drive"". Last time we loved it. We had a truly enthusiastic driver called Charles who gave us a fantastic drive. This time, with another driver, it was more disappointing. The cheetahs looked sad and dusty and nothing was done to cheer them up... Still, I guess if it would have been a first time we would have been happy. The Eland Drive is a very good chance to get close and take nice photos.This time we also did something we missed before - the cheetah museum. Big and interesting and for all ages.

We had a 16 day self drive tour setup by Jennifer T. who made the planning process very easy (e.g. calibration of places to stay) and was able to make customized adjustments for us.  The part that is best though is that their local knowledge is excellent to plan things that we did not think of (e.g. the setup of their 4x4s, extra tires, coolers, GPS, guidance on where to stop by/visit etc...) and that they were available by mobile for any emergencies/advice while you were travelling in country.

Annarueddenklau,"Brombachtal, Germany","Great holiday, would love to go again","In September 2023 we did a 2-week tour with a rental car and lodge overnight stays in Namibia, which we booked through Namibia Tours & Safaris.Our itinerary was as follows: Windhoek-Sossusvlei-Swakopmund-Twyfelfontein-Etosha-Otjiwa. We can fully recommend this route, especially for the first trip to Namibia. The landscape was very varied and we saw a lot of animals.The communication with Namibia Tours & Safaris before the trip was very friendly and helpful, we always got a response very quickly. We were also offered the tour, which included the rental car, lodge overnight stays, breakfast and usually dinner, at a fair price.Unfortunately, the air conditioning in our car broke down on site, but here too NTS helped us quickly and made sure that the air conditioning was repaired. It can always happen that something breaks. Otherwise, the rental car was really great, very clean, equipped with a USB port and a cool box.The individual stops on our tour: 1. Stop in Windhoek with an overnight stay at the Elegant Guesthouse. The accommodation is great for arriving and relaxing and has a lovely outdoor area with a pool. The rooms are nice and clean. The owner is very helpful and reserved a table for us in the evening at Joe's Beerhouse, which we can also recommend. The decor is definitely something special, you shouldn't miss it, but the food was also really good, especially the pizza and the vegetarian mushroom burger. 2. Stop in Sossusvlei with an overnight stay at the Desert Homestead Lodge. The lodge has a fantastic location, although it is not very far from the road, you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere. The houses are beautifully furnished and have a small seating area at the front from which you can watch oryx antelopes. A trip to Dead Vlei or the dunes should be started early in the morning! We were glad that the staff gave us this tip and we set off early. It would have been too strenuous for us in the midday heat... so we preferred to relax with a cocktail by the pool. Dinner is a non-vegetarian 3-course meal as standard. We are all vegetarians, but that wasn't a problem. The menu was modified for us and was very tasty on both evenings. 3rd stop Swakopmund with overnight stay in the Luxury Suites. On the way from Sossusvlei to Swakopmund you drive over the Gaub Pass and the Kuiseb Pass, which is a scenic highlight. It is also recommended to take a detour via the two waterholes Ganab and Hotsas. In the area we were lucky enough to see springboks, ostriches, guinea fowl, vultures and even giraffes. You can also take a detour to see the Welwitschia plants and the Moon Landscape. In our opinion, the Welwitschia plants weren't that worth seeing, but you can do it, but you don't have to. The Moon Landscape was very impressive, though.The Luxury Suites in Swakopmund are very stylishly furnished, and the good breakfast with a large selection of fresh fruit, nuts, cereal, avocado and sweet pastries is particularly noteworthy. From there we took a trip to Walvis Bay and went kayaking with seals. Even though it was extremely cold, it was so much fun, one seal even let us stroke its belly. You should only bring a change of clothes, as you can get wet. 4th stop: Twyfelfontein Adventure Camp. The drive to Twyfelfontein was admittedly rather unspectacular. But the Twyfelfontein Adventure Camp was all the more spectacular. We stayed in the new premium tents, which are super stylishly furnished. We did the Huab Nature Drive there and our guide tracked down the desert elephants and giraffes for us. The only criticism of this lodge for us was the dinner. There was grilled meat (which is definitely great if you like meat) and a buffet with salad and side dishes. For us there was ""only"" the salad and side dish buffet, which was good and sufficient, but nothing special.5th stop Etosha National Park with 1 night in Etosha Village and 2 nights in Onguma Bush Camp.Etosha Village is a fairly large lodge and although it was fully booked while we were there, it didn't seem overcrowded. Dinner is a large, very extensive buffet with something for everyone. We particularly liked the freshly prepared wok on the grill. We also thought it was great that you come across kudus and dikdiks all over the complex.You should plan plenty of time for the drive to Onguma Bush Camp through Etosha National Park if you want to take a few detours via the waterholes. We saw lots of animals like zebras, wildebeests, giraffes, elephants, dikdiks and impalas, as well as a cheetah from a long way away, although this could only be seen properly with binoculars. Unfortunately, we missed lions, leopards and rhinos, even though we had taken the Rhino Drive especially... what a pity. As we really wanted to see lions, we booked a sundowner drive in the Onguma Game Reserve and actually found a group of lions. The Onguma Game Reserve is also very beautiful with its many palm trees and we can recommend the sundowner drive. Another recommendation from us is the Onguma Bush Breakfast, where you are driven into the bush and are offered a small private breakfast buffet. We spent our entire day in the Onguma Bush Camp at the pool and waterhole, which was visited by many animals such as giraffes, warthogs and jackals throughout the day. Special praise goes to the vegetarian and vegan food. 5th stop Otjiwa Safari Lodge. The last highlight of our tour was rhino tracking. We found a group of 5 rhinos and walked very close to them. Very impressive! You should just remember that the rhino tracking starts at 6:30 a.m. and it is still VERY cold in the morning (1 degree C here). In the afternoon we visited the Cheetah Conservation Fund, a breeding station for cheetahs. Here we were able to observe cheetahs up close and our guide explained a lot to us about cheetahs. All in all, a great, eventful trip. If we travel to southern Africa again, we will definitely book with Namibia Tours & Safaris again!",3-Oct-23,Family,Dune 7

Deadvlie is right below Big Daddy Dune. I walked only a small way up the dune but then took a short cut to get to Deadvlie. That was  still hard going( I am 60+) and not very fit. But it was worth it. No one could ever take a bad photograph here. The contrast of clay pan, blackish dead trees, red dunes and blue sky, it is just so beautiful and very serene.

Anne H,"Cork, Ireland",Remote but fascinating site,"It's a long way to Twyfelfontein but well worth the visit. The remoteness of the area has probably helped to preserve the huge number of rock engravings from the bygone era of the San people.

There are viewing platforms here and there that provide a good vantage point for inspecting some of the more intricate scenes. Morning is the best time to take photos. The visitor centre is quite basic, there is a small shop selling local craftwork, a photo exhibition and a kiosk selling cool drinks. The staff are local and friendly.

Ansua111,UAE,A must see programme about conservation of one of earth's most beautiful animals.,"Cheetah Conservation Fund â OtjiwarongoThe Cheetah Conservation Fund is not a wildlife or game park but rather an education and conservation programme which closely works with farmers across different Conservancies in Namibia.   A third of the Cheetahâs in the world live in Namibia and mainly live on commercial farmland. As they are diurnal, as against the nocturnal Leopard or Hyena, and seen during the day time, they tend to be unfairly accused of livestock deaths and are killed by farmers.   The Cheetahs here were brought as orphaned cubs after their mothers were killed. As they have been reared by humans and have no hunting skills, they cannot be released into the wild. CCF does not have a breeding programme hence males and females are kept in separate large pens.  The CCF has a breeding programme for Anatolian Sheepdogs and also large herds of goats. The puppies are reared amongst goats  and the CCF educates farmers on how to care for their livestock using these dogs. We went on a drive around two of the pens, where we saw the Cheetahs up close.   There are 3 â 4 in each pen, including one who sadly had lost an eye from the sharp and long Bush thorns).  Over the last few years, there has been a recorded increase in Cheetah numbers and a dramatic reduction in the number of orphaned Cheetah Cubs being brought to CCF.  This hopefully shows that CCFâs work is delivering results.   Visiting CCF before we went to Etosha gave us a greater awareness of the issues around wildlife conservation, managing human-wildlife conflict and Namibiaâs efforts in wildlife conservation. We met some farmers during our travels, whose view was that Cheetahs were largely responsible for livestock deaths and that they were not endangered. Clearly, CCFâs work while making a big impact, is far from done. CCFâs work is truly inspiring and I would put it on a Must Do list while in Namibia. BushBlok --------------The rapid spread of Thornbush is a menace (valuable water is sucked up and animals cannot graze), so CCF has started a programme called BushBlok where Thornbush is converted into wood fuel briquettes. If you find them in your nearby store, please buy them and support CCFâs work.  Activities-------------Cheetah Run - The Cheetah Run starts @ 8 am and is when you can witness one of natureâs most amazing spectacles. Cheetahs can apparently reach upto 110 kmph for short distances and go from 0- 60 kmph in 3 seconds.  They are normally fed 6 days a week with one day of fasting.  They are fed from a speeding vehicle which they chase. Whenever a run is scheduled, they are not fed the previous day so pre booking at least 4 days in advance is essential.  You can book the Cheetah Drive ( 3 hours â prebooking needed),  Behind The Scenes which takes you takes you in much greater and hand on detail on the CCF workings (full day session - prebooking needed ; limited numbers only). The 1 hour Cheetah pen drive does not need any pre booking. Email - visit@ccfnamibiaorg",31-Aug-15,Couples,Namutoni

Anthony K,"Boston, MA",Highly recommended,"I did a 12 day self-drive safari in Namibia which was organized by Jennifer Timlin.  Jennifer was very friendly, knowledgable and efficient.  She was receptive to my needs and did not engage in any aggressive selling tactics.  She responded promptly to all email communication.  Her  included a driving plan, lodging booking and a comprehensive set of travel recommendations on what to do/see. I was met promptly at the airport and taken to Windhoek where I received a comprehensive vehicle (Wayne Wentzel) and trip briefing (Carlo Basson).My vehicle was an automatic, 4x4 Toyota Fortuner with a double tank.  The vehicle was in excellent condition and I experienced no difficulties during my drive.  Wayne went over the vehicle in great detail (including tire changing). Windshield and tire insurance were provided and this is absolutely necessary.  While it is possible (and cheaper) to get by with a 2 wheel drive vehicle,  a 4x4 is preferable given some of the road conditions.  Garmin navigation, a cold box and a cell phone (with contact numbers) were provided.  Carlo reviewed my drive itinerary and made valuable trip suggestions.  I received a comprehensive trip outline and a map.The lodges were all well chosen and I had adequate time to visit all sites.  There were no safety concerns during my time in Namibia.  Drive times can be long - up to 6 hours between sites.  Road conditions vary between tar and fair condition gravel (the majority), poor condition gravel (some) and very poor (the minority).  ATMs are available in towns and cities.  Lodges, shops, and restaurants take credit cards.  Some gas stations take credit cards but be prepared to pay in cash.  Credit cards are variably accepted at parks/attractions.  A cell phone was provided but SIM cards are available at the airport.

A couple of minutes later, we managed to back out onto more solid sand in low ration and made our way back to the tarmac.  Of course, you can always get the shuttle but it's much more fun on your own - if you have a decent 4x4.Once at the car park at the end of the sand track it is a 15 minute walk over the hot sands to Deadvlei.

You can take the transport in for $50 but it's more exciting to walk and it's not that far. We climbed the sand dunes and looked down on Deadvlei and then ran down the side of the dune - quite an experience. By the time we came back we had drunk nearly 2 litres of water so go well equipped and you will have a fabulous desert experience.

AzRat,Arizona,Must see attraction,May 2022 - Our second visit to Sossusvlei on two different self drive safaris in Namibia. A absolute must see natural beauty attraction. Worth it to have a guided tour for explanation of how the dunes are formed but not necessary to enjoy the area. On this visit in May 2022 it was easy to self drive 4x4 to Deadvlei/Big Daddy parking area. In the past we used the âshuttle serviceâ from the 55km parking area and saw many sand stuck self drivers. Maybe this yearâs ample rain helped. Either way this is a great nature park experience.,15-Jun-22,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole
AzRat,Arizona,Start to Finish Great Service,"We just returned from a Namibia three week self drive holiday arranged by Namibia Tours and Safaris. Our personal travel consultant Tanya modified an Ultimate Namibian Safari for our wants and needs. My emails were always replied to, questions answered and details explained, our modification requests handled promptly, and over a nine month time frame a great holiday was assembled. From our efficient contact with Tanya, our meet and greet in Windhoek with Estelle, and our interaction with Wayne, the vehicle fleet coordinator in Windhoek, we were very pleased with the service NTS provided. We had no problems with our lodgings, transfers, or our vehicle rental. We were provided on arrival with 24-hour contact information and a great, detailed, guide for our entire holiday stops, tour suggestions, etc. and our vehicle had the GPS info preprogrammed. My partner and I had researched many tour providers on TA, TA forums, other travel forums and message boards. NTS had positive feedback and after our initial consult we never considered another tour company. We normally travel independently and book all our own details however we were willing to pay a small premium for their services and enjoyed a holiday where NTS did the planning and we just had fun! We also felt very comfortable renting our 4x4 vehicle directly from NTS as the forums are full of stories of rental problems from other suppliers. Our vehicle pickup and drop off were quick yet comprehensive. NTS also must have some sway in the Namibia tourism community as we had some small problems with tour operators associated with our lodgings on two occasions.  However a mention of contacting the NTS office with our dissatisfaction led to immediate positive resolutions with the tour operators. Overall a very positive experience with NTS, start to finish great service. If you require comprehensive tour planning I highly recommend Namibia Tours and Safaris. During our self drive we met several other NTS clients who were also very pleased with the service level they were receiving. Good Job!",23-Oct-15,Couples,Namib-Naukluft National Park

AzRat,Arizona,Life after man,"Taken from the title of a popular science tv show and an episode actually was filmed at  Kolmanskop. Fascinating scenic and historical tour, and insight into the diamond industry, of the Kolmanskop 'ghost town'. Abandoned after the diamond field moved the town is slowly being reclaimed by the desert. Located a ten minute drive from Luderitz and one hour drive from Aus. Kolmanskop offers two daily guided tours, Mon - Sat, one tour on Sunday, of this former diamond mining company town. The tour is included with the entry fee of $N90. The tour was informative and entertaining, and an interpretive guide is required to fully understand the history of this attraction as there is no signage for a self tour. Guided tour was roughly 45 minutes long then you are allowed to wander about the town on your own for several hours.  Don't miss the smuggling exhibit in the main building library. The town is still owned by the mining company and basically left untouched and intact. Climbing through the old buildings can be dangerous as floors are missing, roofs have collapsed, etc, so be careful exploring.  We visited on a Sunday which has only one tour at 10:00. Fascinating from a historical perspective and a photographers playland.

There are numerous benches for visitors.  And a multi-level bleacher overlook with concrete seating.  (Bring a pad to sit on.)The waterhole is floodlit at night so viewing is 24/7.  We saw rhinos drinking at night.  Enthralled.Waterhole has substantial housed pump to keep it full all year.It is one of the best free wildlife performances on the planet.

barb63788,"Sydney, Australia",self drive in Namibia,"Prior to leaving for Africa I was somehow a little apprehensive about our self drive, however it turned out to be a fantastic adventure for our family. We left VIctoria falls and made our way straight to Namibia with no trouble. Namibia tours and safaris helped us put together our itinerary. They did an excellent job, all accommodation was good except for the last stay in Windhoek, where we stayed at Auas lodge. Even though the location was good in terms of distance from airport, the accommodation was deprived of any positive ""vib"". We spent about 3 days in the North of the country prior to making our way south to Swakopmund and Sossusvlei.  The North is still very traditional and under developed similar to Botswana whereas the South was strange and eerie, with kilometers of desert and then suddenly, out of nowhere a town or village would rise. Swakopmund was a weird mix of German and seaside town. From there we traveled to Sossusvlei which did not disappoint. Highlights of trip included staying in various lodges by the river in the Caprivi's strip, Cheetah preservation Fund, Kayaking with seals, sandboarding in sand dunes, travelling to Sossusvlei and Sossusvlei itself.

I did enjoy the tour, learning about life in the town, seeing some of the intact buildings so you can get an idea of how Mother Nature takes back what is hers with the other ruined buildings.  There is a lot of debris such as glass and metal in the sand, nails in floor boards, etc.This is not Disneyland people, yet parents were letting kids run around barefoot - I would not recommend it.

BarryMartin,Stellenbosch,F1 Donkey Cart,"I had visited this place in the early 1980's and seeing it again reinforced my conviction that this was one of those special places. The rock formations are incredible and the sunsets gorgeous, painting the rock in ever-changing hues. We were visited by two Klipspringers, dassies and numerous birds. During the night we were woken by a strange noise â like a mule in agony. I wish I knew what that haunting sound was made by?! It carried on until after sunrise but we never did work out what was making it.At sunset we heard a commotion and a local lad came past on a donkey cart while we were enjoying our dinner. He was going like the proverbial clappers and as I knew there was a tricky corner about 100 metres ahead I waited for the inevitable wipe-out. Surprisingly it never came. Clearly Lewis Hamilton with the whip and the cheery yet nonchalant wave knew the place better than we.The only criticism I could level is against the people that run it â the facilities at the gate and the go-karts aka âlong-dropsâ at the camp-sites really need some serious attention. Either you have it or you donât, but if you do then you better make sure it all works properly and is kept hygienic and spotlessly clean.",12-May-14,Couples,Epupa Falls
BarryMartin,Stellenbosch,The Twyfelfontein experience,"Twyfelfontein is one of the better tourist attractions in Namibia.

She knew her trees and plants and while walking between the engraving sites she told us a lot about the plants and explained the meaning of the Bushman names giving in depth explanations of the medicinal and nutritional value of these plants to those nomadic peoples.The engravings themselves are quite stunning and I feel more should be done to protect them from the elements. In some places natural attrition has all but wiped them off the rock. Annelie went to great lengths to explain the meaning of the engravings but I guess we can read what we want into some of them. Sorry Annelie but your penguins donât look anything like penguins â Iâm still trying to figure that one out.Viewing platforms built to offer better views of these petroglyphs are a nice touch making photography a lot easier.The informative display at the end of the tour has been very well done and visitors should take some time to peruse it.",15-May-14,Couples,Etosha_Pan

We saw a bunch of females run and it was absolutely fascinating . The volunteers there answered all our questions and it is something I will absolutely recommend. A tour of the place is also included in this, but the person in charge of this had to be coaxed to take us around and give us more information. We also chose to go on the cheetah drive - which was awesome. The driver provided us with tons of information about CCF, the cheetahs and Namibia as such. He was great, the drive was also great.

The reason I rated this as average is the concept they are trying to portray doesn't exactly seem to ring true to form. Granted they are caring for 42 cheetahs on these premises and if you look at the cost of keeping them here it seems rather extravagant since there is little to no chance of them being re-introduced into the wild. After speaking with local farmers there is not a positive reaction to how things actually happen between CCF and them. After seeing, first hand here, and hearing other local information, it causes one to second guess some of the motives behind this grand looking place.It causes many of us to have a bad taste left in our mouths and that has NOTHING to do with the cheetahs and their natures.",28-Aug-13,Friends,Otjikoto Lake

Walking on sand is hard, every step sinks into the sand, making each step longer. I wouldn't recommend this if you aren't reasonably fit.

The cars are always of good quality, are always equipped exactly as we want it, and the support on the road is fantastic (flat tyres, chipped windscreen) as they know exectly where you have to go to service the car. They also know the out-of-the-way places to go to, the more adventurous places where not many other tourists come, and they are always a phone call away if you are not sure.

We do not recommend that you drive by your own. You will miss so much of everything around you. Now we had a experienced driver, a good car and we learned something all the time we were on the road. Our driver was Paolo de Oliveira, whom we can highly recommend. He is fluent in English, Portugues and Afrikaans.The itenerary was almost perfect though we had to travel 2700 km in 12 days. It was definitely worth it. We stayed two days in Swakopmund, which was one day too much. Especially as the sun is not always present. If you have to stay there two days we can recommend a lunch at the nearby golf club. From the restaurant you can spot plenty of animals walking around on the fairways.

Namibia hosts the largest wild cheetah population in the world, about a third of the number. We watched a video that gave a helpful background to the issues threatening the survival of the cheetah, and then we went on a conducted jeep tour of the reserve where we could view these beautiful creatures.We learnt of the Fund`s Livestock Guard Dog Programme where Anatolian Shepherd puppies are introduced to herds of sheep and goats, with which they bond, and then as the dogs mature, are used to protect the herds.To date CCF has placed about 500 dogs on Namibian livestock farms, and farmers report an 80% decrease in livestock losses. This persuades the farmers not to hunt the cheetahs.There is a cafe and shop. We were impressed by the dedication and commitment of the staff.

Consequently when you are climb and especially if you are on a steep face of the dune, you will slip down half a much as you climb up. There is an easier route starting at the left end of the dune and climbing/walking up the backbone of the dune.  Coming down is a lot easier and more exciting; you form a miniature sand avalanche.

We drove fast, but were passed by others and realized we couldn't make it to Big Daddy for sunrise. So, we climbed Dune 45 (with a long line of other people...), sat on top to enjoy the sunrise (a great family experience), then climbed down and drove to Big Daddy. We drove our own 4x4 right to the parking lot, after we noticed that the shuttle was the same truck as ours. However, if you aren't experienced driving in sand (we were), take the shuttle, for us it was like the Indiana Jones jeep ride at Disney. We walked across a big pan and then started up the dune, it cut off some of the sand climb. The climb was incredible, the views surreal, have never done anything like this. The last bit at the top is a bit scary-very windy, narrow , I couldn't look down. But at the top, it was panoramic red dunes as far as you could see, so beautiful. it was still early morning so the colours were great, and running down to Deadvlei (take off your shoes if you didn't already for the climb) was so much fun, lots of room so you aren't following someone's tracks. Walking across the dry clay pan at Deadvlei in bare feet from the bottom of Big Daddy gave us time alone away from the crowds at the other end of the pan,  Seeing the beauty of this area was dazzling but in climbing Big Daddy and walking across the  Deadvlei, we feel like we really experienced it, and it made the trip for us.

Our trip was organised by the Mowani Mountain Camp, where we stayed for 2 nights during visit to Namibia. At Twyfelfontein you can view rock carving estimated to be as old as 6000 years. There are supposedly 2500 known rock carvings scattered throughout the region, making this the largest concentration of petroglyphs in all of Africa. Entrance cost is presently NAD$60 per foreign adult and includes a guide who will show up 10-12 sites where you will see large slabs with carvings of lions, giraffes, oryx and all manner of  animals that were known to be found in the area. You will also see images of waterholes, springs and other images which have been long preserved due to the lack of rain and dry climate found in the area. Guides inform that the indigenous bushman made the carvings as a means to educate youth and to leave signs helping to identify what animals and water sources could be found in the area.  Note: There is a car park with security just a short walk to the Twyfelfontein Centre where you pay your entrance and are assigned a guide. A small shaded seating area and toilet facility can be found there as well. The walk from the centre to the carvings is around 15 minutes and the total visit time is around 45-60 minutes. Note: You can combine visits to Twyfelfontein with Organ Pipes and the Burnt Mountain, which are unique land formations worth having a look for anyone with interest in geology. These are located nearby making it convenient to see before or after a visit to Twyfelfontein.

Brad,"Hong Kong, China",Ancient acacia tree skeletons in the at Sossusvlei,"Deadvlei is an area of Sossusvlei which includes the ancient remains of acacia trees which have been dead for over 600 years yet rest mostly undisturbed and well preserved due to the extremely dry climate in this area of the Namib-Naukluft Park in Namibia.Here you find a white clay pan surrounded by dunes on all sides. The pan is home to 50 or so tree skeletons some of which remain standing while others have fallen, centuries ago. In the distant past, this area was flooded at times when the nearby Tsauchab river had water, allowing for the acacia and camel thorn trees to grow. However, around 700 years go a drought occurred, followed by shifting sands which formed a new dune that blocked the water flow from the nearby river from entering the shallow pan ever again. The acacia trees with their deep roots would have survived for a while but eventually died out, providing what you can see today at this extraordinary location in Namibia. Note: Most visitors include a stop and climb at Dune 45 along the road between the Sesriem Gate and Sossulvlei where you find Deadvlei. The large groups then make way to Deadvlei. If you prefer to avoid the crowds, you can make your visit in the opposite direction, starting with Deadvlei first and then visiting Dune 45 later on. Note: There is a car park at the end of the Sossusvlei road. At this point there are 2-3 more kilometres of driving on very soft sand which requires 4 wheel drive and some driving experience in order to avoid becoming stuck. At the car park, there is free tractor pull shuttle service for those who prefer to leave their vehicles and not attempt the drive further into Sossusvlei to see Deadvlei.",26-Sep-16,Couples,Namutoni

While less popular than Dune 45, Big Daddy is three times its size, making it much more challenging for climbers. You'll find Big Daddy by driving the road between the Sesreim Gate and Sossusvlei. There is a small car park there for those who don't wish to make the last bit of drive on the soft sand where 4 wheel drive is required. Free tractor pull shuttle service is provided from there. Otherwise, just drive onward to the next car park just next to the Big Daddy dune. If you don't fancy a climb that is ok. However, do make sure to snap a few photos of Big Daddy. Its monstrous and very attractive. Many simply rush to Deadvlei and sort of forget that Big Daddy, one of the tallest dunes in the world is right there reaching for the sky.

Brighton,"Brighton, UK",Wonderful place full of brilliant ideas,We had the trip of a life time round the centre and were treated like royalty.  The amazing work on behalf of the Cheetahs of Namibia is heartwarming.  There are so many aspects to the work carried out at Otiwarongo.  We stayed in the Lodge which was the height of luxury and got up close and personal with the 'Ambassadors' 4 Cheetahs that have spent their life at the centre.  The aim of the centre is to educate and provide locals with the tools to keep the cheetahs from stealing their cattle.  Their innovative way of dealing with the problems include breeding dogs that they then sell to the farmers.  The Centre its self is full of information and a paradise for an animal lover and children.  Well worth a visit even if it is up a rather bad track from the main road.,7-Dec-17,Couples,Namutoni
Brisbane,"Brisbane, Australia","What an amazing experience, must do, if youâre in the area!","We thoroughly enjoyed our time meeting all the cheetahs and hearing about how they are at risk in the wild but well cared for here at the conservation fund.  Itâs a pleasant drive (by Namibian road standards) around 45mins from Otjiwarongo to the entrance.  After paying our entrance fee for all our activities we were taken on a safari with our knowledgeable guide Job who was very informative about the cheetahs, who we finally found well camouflaged and asleep!!  He told us all about the dog programs that they operate to educate landowners and how they are unable to be released back into the wild as they are now dependent on the foundation to meet their needs.  We then watched a video in the education centre and went through the museumâ¦really very interesting.  The next activity was the feeding of all the cheetahsâ¦absolute precision in its execution!  The cheetahs were pacing for a long time before they were actually fed and the interactions between them was entertaining to say the least!  The staff know the habits and natures of each of the âcatsâ incredibly wellâ¦.a real experience not to be missed, if you have the time!

The walk was maybe 30-40 minutes, nice in the early evening when the sand was a little cooler (especially when you plunge your heels in deep), and the temps lower than at midday.

It's definitely more touristy than nearby Hiddenvlei (which is absolutely worth the 2km walk out), but if you're there in low season and late afternoon, or if you're just lucky, you can have the place pretty much to yourself. Some people drive out, but beware the sand. If you're unfamiliar with driving in deep sand, just hire a guide to take you out and leave your truck in the parking lot. On that note, last ride out seems to be around 4 or 5pm, so don't show up too late in the evening, otherwise you'll be forced to drive out on your own or return the next day.",10-Jan-20,Solo,Namutoni
Brittany_11_10,"Los Angeles, CA",Probably great in dry season,"I think the viewing possibilities at this water hole are really dependent on the season. If you read enough reviews on here, you'll see that people who visit during dry season tend to see heaps of animals here (basically b/c the rest of the park is bone dry, so they have to go to these big water holes to quench their thirst). People who visit during rainy season, however, don't tend to see many--if any--game at this waterhole. Given that we were there at the beginning of January, we were in the latter group. That said, the waterhole was big and the viewing area was spacious (and went a good deal around the waterhole), so had game arrived, it wouldn't have been difficult for a lot of people to have good viewing spots. As it was, it was nice to sit on one of the benches at night, quench our own thirst with some Hunter ciders, and watch a few birds doing some nighttime snacking (on bugs). As for the reviewer two down--lourensm1365--what a ridiculous review. First off, the roads were absolutely fine. Compared to some other parks, they were excellent. Gravel, yes, but quite maintained otherwise. Plus, you're in a nature reserve--of sorts. Do you want everything to be tarred and more ""manmade""? I sure don't. Secondly, it's absurd to think that the only place anyone can see game is at the waterholes. We went at the beginning of January--so the height of rainy season--and still saw loads of animals: hyenas and jackals galore (including some feasting on an elephant carcass); giraffes; loads of zebra, springbok, wildebeest, and black-faced impala; three types of mongoose; half a dozen black rhino, including a baby (!); two leopards (one of which we watched for 10 or 15 minutes, all to ourselves); and so much more. You have to get up early and go out right away, go slow, be patient, have your windows down so you can hear and smell potential animals nearby, stay out until sundown... A lot of people don't game drive ""properly"" and then complain about not seeing animals, and it's ridiculous. Etosha is very rich in wildlife.",7-Jan-20,Solo,Namutoni

Anyway, back to Spitz. It's a beaut place with great hiking, bouldering, or just sunset/sunrise-watching. I noticed that someone who gave it three stars called it boring, but I wholeheartedly disagree. I mean, sure, if you're not into gorgeous sunsets and sunsrises, peace and quiet, watching rock dassies and squirrels scamper about, hiking and camping in near-seclusion, I suppose you might find it boring. But if you like any of those things, this is your place.

We embarked in the specially prepared safari vehicle (modified Toyota) which could easily accommodate our entire group (2 families: 4 adults and 3 children).    Our guide Omar proved to be very kind and friendly from the first discussions we had after the start; he answered very detailed to all our questions related to the places/villages we saw on the trip but also about the local culture and habits, he provided details about the history of the country and the current status, made also jokes and some Q&As with the kids, making in this way the whole trip from Mombasa to Tsavo Natural Park more pleasant and interesting for all of us. He stopped also in nice places where we could find souvenirs but also in a traditional Maasai village for seeing live the actual life, culture and habits of the villagers.   Once we entered in Tsavo Park we were astonished by the beauty of the landscape and by the variety of animals which could be admired during the 3 days safari. Our guide Omar was very knowledgeable about the various animal species which could be seen during the safari, giving us explanations about them but also knowing the best places where the main attractions could be found (elephants, zebras, lions, leopards, giraffes, monkeys, vultures and lots of various birds, different antelopes, ostriches, hippos, crocodiles and many others).

Umm..... o.k. Also, not a lot is really known about the shamanism at the time so some of the other interpretations are a bit speculative, especially as some are claimed to nave been produced when the shaman was ""in a trance"".This is a site worth seeing because of the age but don't expect to be overwhelmed by its significance.",12-Dec-13,Couples,Namutoni

She was sensitive to my every need and made an all-out effort to get me exactly what I wanted.  She remained patient and good-humored through the many changes I requested.  I couldn't have had a better operator.  I flew to three camps: Sossusvlei, where I stayed at Moon Mountain Lodge; Twyflefontain, where I stayed at Mowani Mountain Camp; and Etosha National Park, where I stayed at Mushara Lodge.  The exceptional lodge was Mowani Mountain Camp, which was perfect in every way.  The rooms are tucked into tremendous boulders and the view and food were outstanding.  It lived up to its luxury billing.  The other two lodges, although advertised as luxury, were a little frayed around the edges, although the staff did everything they could to make my visit a success.  And their food was also very tasty.  Best of all, my vegetarian needs were sensitively seen to at all the lodges.A final word goes to my two pilots from Wings Over Africa, Ryan and Daan, who flew me from camp to camp.  They were charming young men, who did everything they could to make the flights interesting.  I loved the experience of flying so low and seeing this beautiful country from the air as well as from the ground.

The drive was an interesting way to get up close to the cheetahs without the fences appearing in any photographs, though itâs obviously quite far from being a safari-type experience (i.e. there half a dozen cheetahs in mid-sized enclosures that they drive around looking for). For what it is itâs kind of over-priced, but if you view it (as I assume is intended) as a donation to the fund, then thatâs absolutely fine.The feeding was interesting and well run with good explanations.

Letâs focus on Wild Wind.Rambo, who is more than just your average guide, took care of us during the entire journey. For context, between us have travelled to 70+ countries and have used guides services around 10 times.  In addition to being one of the most knowledgeable guides we have ever had, Rambo is also an ardent conservationist, enthusiastic ornithophile (the man knows his birds), an expert tracker (can spot an animal several kilometres away), a massive knowledge brain on nature, animals and culture -- and above all a top-class ambassador for his beloved Namibia. Rambo has taught us about Namibian history, African culture & regional history, Himba culture, animal behaviour â and has even sparked a new-found interest in us for bird watching! He was extremely patient and willing to both suggest options from his experience (i.e. pre-sunrise journeys) and divert slightly to accommodate some of our own interests (i.e. Meerkat watching in the Namib, trying to spot dik-diks, Rhinos). We were very fortunate to have seen ~30 lions and several leopards and a cheetah during our time in Etosha. Really an amazing place! We count Rambo as one of our friends â he has a kind heart and shares his thoughts openly.Thank you, David at Wild Wind Safaris for arranging our time in Namibia.

We have previously used UK based companies to arrange travel outside Europe via a local agent. On this occasion, whilst trying to explore options I discovered a NTS website which enabled us to look at individual lodges and compare much more easily what local agents were using. Contacting the company I did not feel under any pressure-indeed we agreed to hold fire for 12 months as there was a lack of accomodation in Damaraland for the current season. When I went back to ask for further clarification and tweeks in 2019 this was well managed and not pushy. Whilst all comms was by e-mail and payment in Namibian dollars a bit of a challenge -this has improved for the balance with a dedicated link to the bank and Halifax cards make it exchange efficient.Ashlee and co were efficient and helpful with regular updates. Lodges-see other reviews were varied but all of excellent standard. A particular gem was Naankuse Lodge outside Windhoek which offered a first night resting spot with animals all around and set the scene for the next 2 weeks.We landed with Namibia Airways at 6.30am so had all day to explore which we really enjoyed rather than a city hotel. This also felt less commercial than AfriCat Foundation. We were collected from the airport as described and collected for our return at 5am-without any concerns he would appear as everything had gone well and when we needed help mid holiday (hotel lost our voucher) -the team were on hand to help-and as if by magic nobody elese eveer seemed to ask for a voucher!

There is a NWR shuttle service available from the parking lot, at the end of the 60 Km tarred road, to take visitors to the vlei with 4x4 vehicles over a few kilometers of deep loose sand tracks.The golden rule is to enter the reserve when the gate opens early in the morning, and exit at the latest time allowed before closing to get the best view of the dunes at sunrise or sunset. Take sufficient water in a ruck sack if possible. A 4x4 vehicle will be an advantage to gain access over the sand tracks and only if you are experienced in deep sand driving and carry rescue ropes. Make use of the shuttle service instead. Do wear closed shoes for walking in the sand, and not open sandals as the sand is abrasive.As a visitor, I felt that the gate operating times are too late or too early to visit the vlei sunrise or sunset which should be reviewed by the authorities. I would recommend that accommodation be booked well in advance at one of the lodges within the boundary of the Nature Reserve.We visited Sossusvlei, and climbed Big Momma Dune at sunset on our first day of arrival. A visit to Big Daddy Dune and the adjacent Deadvlei was great at sunrise. A visit to the Deadvlei is a 'must do'",8-Jul-17,Couples,Waterberg National Park

Car061,"Brighton and Hove, UK",An outstanding trip! The best holiday ever,"Thank you Daniela and NTS!From the moment I contacted NTS, Daniela, our travel consultant, helped me plan the most amazing self drive holiday. She was efficient and friendly,providing excellent suggestions and advice. The hotels and lodges were of a high standard, Etendeka Mountain Camp and Hoodia Lodge were particularly special and the activities we booked were really interesting. I would particularly recommend kayaking with seals in Swakopmund and bush walks. The vehicle was well maintained and driving in Namibia is such fun, as the roads are empty! The organisation in Namibia was perfect and the trip notes, car delivery etc..were faultlessWhen there was a problem with our booking in Etosha, NTS sorted out alternative accomadation, within an hour and the care that Daniela showed for the rest of the trip was above and beyond. I think that the way in which a company responds when things do not go as planned, is a good way of assessing the quality of service and NTS were fantastic and proved themselves a responsive and caring company, who care about their clients. Namibia is a diverse, fascinating and beautiful country, I can't wait to return and I will certainly use NTS and would encourage anyone considering a trip to do so.",19-Sep-15,Family,Spitzkoppe

CarmenVancouverBC,"Vancouver, Canada","NTS, the only choice!!","We never use tour companies, but Africa is a bit different and it was important for us to have a local company handle all the arrangements. We did our research and chose Namibia Tours & Safaris (NTS). We knew we wanted a guide/driver,  we had a budget in mind and a list of places we wanted to see. Bianca was our NTS representative and together we came up with an awesome 3 week safari!!  We drove close to 5000 km and visited Windhoek, Kalahari Desert, Luderitz/Kolmanskop (ghost town), Namib Desert, Skeleton Coast, Damaraland, Etosha National Park, Central Namibia and back to Windhoek.Our accommodations were very good for the most part and NTS was kind enough to allow us the use their company safari vehicle. As photographers we really wanted the flexibility of a pop-up roof and windows that slid open to the side.Our guide/driver's name was Augustinus and he played a huge part in making this a trip of a life time. Knowing we were photographers and how important it was for us to make the most of this Namibian safari, He made sure we never missed a sunrise and was very cognisant of the ""right"" light. Augustinus took us to locations we would never have found on our own and had extensive knowledge in the wonders of Namibia,  including geology, geography, history and nature... In a nut shell he took very good care of us throughout our 3 weeks together.  We arrived as strangers and left as friends...We want to thank Bianca of NTS for making a dream come true and also for teaming us with our guide Augustinus!For us, NTS is the only choice and we have already recommended them to a number of people here at home.Cheers and happy travels!  :)",18-Jul-16,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Caroline K,"Harrisville, PA",Exceptional- Trip of a lifetime,"Namibia Tours and Safaris did an excellent job of organizing our private tour/safari/game drives/ cultural experiencesâ¦ of Namibia, Botswana and Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.  Shout out to Wilmari for working so diligently with us to customize the experience and meet our needs (gluten free food options, accommodations, additional points of interest â¦)  The trip flowed in a seamless fashion.This trip exceeded expectations!  From the first moment of meeting Augustinus, (guide/driver) at the airport with his genuine smile, positive energy and enthusiasm for our journey, there was no doubt we made the right decision.  Every moment of the trip was well organized, efficiently run and filled with interesting information.  The vehicle was clean, comfortable, air conditioned, well equipped and regularly checked for safety.  A beautiful mix of the landscape (dunes, acacia forests, seaside, national parksâ¦.) everyday was an adventure waiting to happen, to the cultural experiences, and of course the nature!!! (Plants, Animals - the Big 5 as well as dozens of other species- mammals, birds, amphibians, reptilesâ¦ an endless list of creatures, up close and personal in their natural habitats).  Iâm still in awe.  Certainly, had we not booked the private tour, we would have missed so much and would not have gained the incredible amount of knowledge and opportunities Augustinus provided for us.  He was 100% on point throughout our entire time together.  When he left us in Botswana, he made sure everything was in order for the next portion of our trip.  Botswana was interesting and beautiful with the open game drives, lovely atmosphere and bush flights!   Our guides were friendly and informative.  The open vehicles get bumpy!!!! A few days in Victoria Falls was enough for us to finish our trip of a lifetime.

Caroline W,"Bristol, UK",Holiday of a lifetime,"We spent 16 wonderful days in Namibia following a self-drive camping/lodge itinerary suggested to us by Namibia Tours & Safaris.  Namibia is a destination we've dreamed of going to but didn't know where to start.  I found Namibia Tours & Safaris on TripAdvisor and, based on their top reviews, thought I'd give them a go.  I was slightly apprehensive to start with as I've only ever booked holidays myself - preferring not to use an agent.  Anja was our representative at the agency and she was great.  We gave her our budget and an idea of what we wanted to do and she came back with a draft itinerary.  Worth mentioning, it's definitely worth booking as far in advance as you can, as places get booked up quickly, particularly the lodges.  The final travel document we received before departure was incredibly detailed.  It gave us lots of information on each area we were visiting, as well as suggested stops en route, travel times, and then lots of info about our accommodation/lodge.  All of it was useful and made our travel stress-free.  We were also given a GPS which was nice, but found Google maps also works well in Namibia if you download the maps before travel.All airport transfers and pick ups were arranged for us which made life very easy.  The 4x4 was rented through Namibia Car Rental and they were very good.We did a loop, starting in Windhoek, down to Kalahari, then Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, Damaraland, Etosha, Waterberg and back to Windhoek.  Roughly two nights per place.  Could have stayed longer everywhere... but we'll just have to go back.The driving is long but easy.  Lots of gravel roads, so be prepared for that.  Some good, some not so good.  Scenery constantly changing.  Our car (Toyota Hilux) was fabulous and we had no problems with tyres or anything else.  Our children (ages 12 and 14) were also very happy - and I do think this is a great age to do this sort of holiday with children.  Our first few nights we camped in Kalahari and then Sesriem.  Then we moved to the luxury of a B&B in Swakopmund.  But after our three nights in Swakopmund, we were itching to get back to camping!  We highly recommend the quad biking and sandboarding in Swakopmund.We spent two nights at Etosha Village (south) and then two nights at Onguma Tamboti (east).  We self-drove through Etosha which was fine, but did pay for a private game drive from Onguma on our last morning which was well worth it - we definitely saw stuff we wouldn't have seen on our own.We loved the Waterberg and unfortunately only had one night there but it's great for hiking if that's your thing.The holiday was so special - great family time.  Highly recommend Namibia and also Namibia Tours & Safaris.  They take all the stress out of organising it!  We will defintely be back!  Thank you.",28-Aug-19,Friends,Onguma Bush Camp

Cassy W,"Sydney, Australia",avoid at all costs- unreliable +++,"Contacted this company on 5 May asking if it was possible to organise a private fly in namibia tailored to what we wanted to do in a short time as a last minute add on to our trip. Unfortunately the agent I was assigned was TERRIBLE. Despite me asking for an individualised package- AND telling her of the time limits we had with this, we were sent some prepackaged itinerary which was much longer than we had the time for. Asking for this to be individualised then took her 4 days to get back to us with a response that basically said she had been too busy to respond. Telling her our confirmed flights and the dates we would be able to start and finish, she then sent us an itinerary starting a day earlier and finishing a day later than our flights. And despite our asking for top end accommodation, she included some lowly ranked B&B in one of the stops. When I asked for this to be changed I have (after waiting another day) received another email that she has been too busy and might be able to look at tomorrow. It is now 5 days to this planned trip so it pretty much assures it cant happen.

At first we were a bit hesitant- being in the hospitality industry ourselves we had not had good dealings with tour companies.However from the start of our communication with Ashlee, I felt like I was her only client and the most important thing on her plate. We changed our mind so many times I think she re did the itinerary so much she must have known it off by heart! But she was incredibly patient and did all she could to fit all our needs in.We did a self drive from Namibia up to the Caprivi and into Botswana where we spent 2 nights in Kasane and then flew into the okavango delta.From start to finish it was so well organised I didnt have to worry about thing- we were collected at the airport by Bettwell who was so friendly and knowledgable. The next day we collected our Vehichle which was great and gave us no problems at all. All th accomodation was exactly as had been discussed and agreed and there were no confusions on arrival at any of the lodges. The transition in Botswana was smooth as could be with Bettwell ready and waiting for us at our final self drive location.I cannot say enough about this great company and Ashlee herself.

Felt like being on a movie set,"Thought this was the best place to see in the Luderitz area.It was very cool to see buildings half full of sand and walls sandblasted to bits, rusting metal and just the power of nature reclaiming her land.I suggest go early as it gets very windy later in the day. Its worth paying extra for the amateur photo permit as you can go in by yourself anywhere between sunrise and sunset. And of you were lucky like us you may be the only people in the area!Take sunglasses and a warm top or windbreaker. It can be chilly and the sand stings.

We were there from sunrise at 630 until 830 and it was plenty of time to see all the buildings inside and out. We didn't wait for the tour as we wanted to get back for breakfast :-)You can buy photo permits at Luderitz Safari and Info on Bismarck street or from Oyster Bar offices on 68 Insel street, which is a bit hard to find but next to a panel beaters and shearwater oyster farm.

chemicallymark,"Suzhou, China",A must see! Spectacular views!,"The dunes are amazing.Hiking up ""big daddy"" was awesome. Very tough but awesome. The views while walking and up on top are spectacular. Deadvlei can be seen on the right and looks great.We took so many photos. If you get to the top you've done well and should feel proud :-)Â The day we went there were about 150 people and i counted only 11 getting to the top. By the time we finished it was so hot (40C at 1130am) there were only about 12 people in the area.If you want to go to the top there are 2 routes: the ""easy"" route and the ""hard"" route. We took the ""easy"" route, which is true for the first 50%, then after that it becomes very tough as you've got to basically crawl up a very steep dune face for about 40m before joining up with the ""hard"" route's trail.The ""hard"" route is more direct and therfore shorter but steeper. I'd say both routes are hard. At least on the ""easy"" route if you want to bail out you can walk down the slopes, which is easy and fun and back along the deadvleiGo early! It gets brutally hot. Take a hat, suncream, sunnies and a long sleeve top to protect your upper body from the sun. If you're walking to the top of big daddy via the ""easy"" route and back along the deadvlei you will need about 3 hours and 2L of water each.You'll need a 4x4 to get to the big daddy dune. If you're not experienced with 4x4 take the shuttle from the 2x4 carpark. Im not sure what the cost is.We stopped at dune 45 on the way back as it gets very crowded in the morning. Also amazing. I reckon best way is do big daddy as early as possible then head back to dune 45. Enjoy!",29-Jan-17,Couples,Namib Desert

Its kinda cool to try imagine how this area would have looked with water and living trees as its so hot, dry and dusty. Its very easy to walk over the deadvlei as its flat. Its about a 1-2km walk from the 4x4 parking lots across sand but the walk is easy enough. Don't try drive here in a 2x4 or if you habe no 4x4 xp!Go early as it gets very hot and the sun reflects very brightly off the deadvlei floor. Sunglasses, a hat and suncream Re a must. And water!Most people seem to attempt the ""easy"" route of ""big daddy"" dune and then bailout and walk back along deadvlei.You can do dune 45 and big daddy dune on the same trip",29-Jan-17,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

We arrived at 10 and had a good look around including the museum and education centre.  The centre is smart and well organised with friendly staff.  Although dependent on donations there was information about how to donate but not in your face, which was refreshing.I recommend you take on of the drive safaris, either a long (3 hour?) one to the further away camp which houses the release cheetahs, or the shorter hour one nearby if you are short on time, which we did.  We decided to go on the ""Eland drive"" option, which takes you on an hour drive around the large enclosures used to keep the female non-release cheetahs in.  Our guide was great, offering good insights and answering all our questions, as well as getting as close as possible to these beautiful cats.  Afterwards there was a chance to get closeup with the ambassador cats (4 young males that cannot be released into the wild) and their keepers in a question and answer session, which they try to do everyday to help the cubs be familiar with visitors and unusual environments.  You are not allowed to touch or pet the cats, as they are still wild animals, but you are able to get close.  (for this ""cub walk session"" the cats are on leads/leashes, but there are plenty of others in the enclosures not on leads when you visit them)All in all a thoroughly interesting morning and a great chance to view some beautiful cheetahs that you may not get visiting other places in Namibia, including the national parks (most cheetahs live on farmland as they do not live well with other cats that live in the parks).",11-Mar-12,Friends,Namib Desert

Chloe N,"London, UK",I was left disappointed.,"We were picked up from our accommodation in Swakopmund punctually. However, from this point things deteriorated. It immediately became apparent Uwe had a booking issue with an agent. We set off to Walvis Bay, with Uwe receiving and making repeated phone calls, which involved Uwe having heated discussions to resolve a booking problem. Uwe was on his mobile NOT a hands free system while driving, including while over taking at considerable speed on the main road to Walvis Bay. This is not a safe way to drive and was stressful for us all. When we arrived at Walvis Bay, Uwe suggested we have a coffee. We agreed and stated we did not wish to continue our tour until the issue was resolved as it was stressful to listen to, and because driving while on a mobile was not safe. An hour later, and long after other cars in the group left, we departed. We were not able to reach Sandwich Harbour via the beach due to spring tides and recent storms. This wasn't very clearly explained until we were looking at Sandwich Harbour from the top of a dune about 1km away. I had thought you could reach Sandwich Harbour via the dunes, but Uwe said not. We returned via the dunes and Kuisib delta. We learnt Uwe didn't have a concession for driving through this area, fees from which go to the local indigenous population. It seemed various Sandwich Harbour tours take this route when other access isn't possible, but without paying the concession fees. This was all rather confusing. Given this is a concession area which requires funds to support it, we were concerned about this approach. Plus our booking form clearly stated all parks fees were included.On a positive note, Uwe had extraordinary skills at spotting animals, and good local knowledge. The dune driving was a great fun, if a little hair-raising at times (but that's the point).Overall I was left disappointed. I had hoped to reach Sandwich Harbour and see the birdlife there, rather than look at it from afar. While storms and tides can't be helped, I was left wondering if we hadn't had the delayed start we would have made it? Uwe said no one made it that day. However, after the approach to driving safety and not paying concessions fees, I wasn't sure what to believe as everything felt a somewhat awkward and uncomfortable.",9-Sep-23,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

Chris A,"San Jose, Costa Rica",Must Do if you visit Namibia,"This is absolutely a ""must-do"" if you visit Namibia.  The pictures are so iconic it would be a shame to travel here and say you didn't see this, but it really is worth the experience. A few high end hotels in the area and a few nice camp sites make it very easy to visit, and I think you only need 1-2 nights at most.  The guides are fantastic as point out wildlife you would never have seen like spider and lizards, and you can see plenty of oryx and ostrich along the drive in.  Lots of amazing sand dunes to climb and get panoramic views from.  Deadvlie itself is amazing, it's been said before but you really feel like you are on a different planet.

Chris and Jean,"Derbyshire, UK",Depends on your interest in anthropology!,"This site is undoubtedly worthy of its status as a World Heritage Site, but that alone is no guarantee that the average person will find it particularly interesting!  It's certainly a pleasant meander around the hillside, and the engravings do need to be preserved, but this is one of those few occasions when [to my mind] a photograph is almost as good...Accordingly, in contrast to hotels where I read the reviews but try and avoid the photographs (so that I am taken by surprise and have something new to look forward to when I get there), in this case I'd be inclined to look at the images and decide if you are sufficiently enthused to go and look at them for yourself.In passing I would also comment (as there doesn't seem to be a separate TA entry) that visitors to Twyfelfontein often also visit the nearby Organ Pipes.  Well, I have to say that they were an anti-climax which I would rate [exceptionally] as 1*, or maybe 2* had I actually been bothered to look at them at close quarters.  There was six of us in our jeep from a nearby lodge, one of whom had recently graduated in geology, but even he couldn't be bothered to get out of the vehicle!

Chris Corbet,"George, South Africa",Desert Reclamation in Progress,"Itâs called a âghost townâ, and it certainly looks like it, with the desert gradually reclaiming the derelict houses and streets, but I think that some of it is staged, at least to some extent. Itâs quite well maintained because itâs a real money spinner for De Beers, who owns the town and are still making money even if diamonds have gone.Nevertheless putting scepticism aside and just wandering through the old houses gradually being reclaimed by the desert sands, imagining the thriving town that it once was, is an extraordinary experience â one that I can highly recommend. Itâs got photo opportunities galore, but itâs best to get there as early as possible, not only because the light is best at that time, but also because I gets extremely hot later in the day. There is a gift shop and restaurant to purchase a trinket to take home or to have a light meal and a cup of coffee or tea.Worth a visit.",28-Nov-18,Couples,Desert Explores

These are child like etchings of human and animal forms carved on sandstone some 5000 years ago by primitive hunter gatherers and presumably only preserved so well because it never rains.

Chris M,"Wetherby, United Kingdom","Great itinerary, good guide but overshadowed by other shortcomings.","We booked a Sense of Africa ""Exploring Namibia"" (Superior) 13 Day Tour (including transfers) through a UK Travel Agent. The itinerary was extensive and one of the reasons that we booked this particular tour. Whilst it is a long time since our trip, we still remember it well. As you would expect, our experience had some good and perhaps not so good points. An initial issue was that the Sense of Africa sub contracted transfer from the airport to the hotel did not arrive, which required us to pursue the matter ourselves. Nevertheless at the start of the tour proper, we were collected from our hotel by what turned out to be a good driver/guide. We ended up with six passengers for the last half of the tour. The overnight accommodation ranged from good to excellent. A couple of itinerary items were missed due to optimistic scheduling, and the vehicle used was perfectly reasonable for tarmac surfaces, but less than ideal for the rougher gravel roads. At the end of our holiday we found it impossible to contact Sense of Africa regarding our booked transfer to the airport and again dealt with the matter ourselves. We took the time to complete and provide the requested tour questionnaire highlighting good and weak points but were disappointed to not even receive an email acknowledgement. We did enjoy Namibia, and fortunately our UK travel agent dealt with the issues more professionally.",17-Nov-24,Solo,Spitzkoppe

During this tour we were advised to be aware of snakes found in the area. We then visited some further buildings independently. One part of the main building also houses an interesting exhibition related to diamond smuggling methods.The site is fascinating having been left to the elements, with the impacts of the shifting sand clearly evident in many of the buildings.

We left Sousselvlei quite early along a good standard tarmac road past a number of large dunes on the way. On arrival we transferred into four wheel drive safari type vehicles to travel through quite deep sand to a point near the Deadvlei. We then needed to walk for 30-40 minutes across sand (deep in places), involving some gradients to reach the Deadvlei. When reaching here it has very individual characteristics with the white of the dried clay contrasting with the black of the old dead trees dotted around. It is certainly different! The visit was worthwhile but ensure that you are relatively fit and have high factor suncream, plenty of water and a hat to counter the heat.

Firstly we were taken to the Chameleon Tours office in Windhoek where we joined a group of four for coffee and biscuits and a briefing of our tour.From there we we driven to our accommodation in Swakopmund via Walvis Bay to look at flamingos, eating a packed lunch on the way that Gregory had prepared for us.

The walk there and back can either be at a low level or involve climbing a dune on its crest and sliding down the side into the vlei. Don't think the lower level option is easy either.

We went early in the morning as recommended and our pictures during this time came out a lot better than than the late morning as would be expected.  We went directly to Big Daddy Dune and arrived around 7am, left the park around 2pm.  I felt like we covered everything in that time (Sesserim Canyon, Deadvlei, Dune 45, Big Daddy, Big Mamma, Sossusvlei).It was not nearly as crowded as we thought it would be, so my wife and I enjoyed the secluded feel of the desert. There were less than a dozen people at the top of Big Daddy in the morning, however I was told by others that November is the slow season.  I was also told December gets crowded due to the Holiday in South Africa.  Overall we had a great time.A couple important notes, as I was stressing the night before:- The entrance fee can be paid in credit card or in cash at the park entrance (campsite desk).  You do not need cash to get in the park.- If you need the shuttle to get the last few km to Big Daddy / Deadvlei, the service fee must be paid cash.  There is an ATM at the gas station just outside the park.- If you have a 4x4, the drive in the sand at the end of the road is perfectly manageable.  This was my first time driving a 4x4 and we were fine.  Just shift into the low gear (test beforehand) and always stay moving, youâll be fine.

What can I do with 5 meters?Nice art but a bit expensive, especially for impulse purchases. Enjoyed the rest, catering in the restaurant was uninterested and slow. That is not normally the case here in Namibia.In short, potentially a top spot, but do something about it...",12-May-24,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole
Christophe G,"Rennes, France",Will the detour,"The site is beautiful with shades of orange and yellow. Even more beautiful at sunset when the rock goes up in flames. The park is not very large compared to the immensities of Namibia but the site is worth a visit. Payment is made at the entrance buildings. Do not forget to stop there because sorite would then be complicated. We drove around this site easily to go for a walk around the arch, the bridge. Great view from the arch and easy access",3-Aug-24,Family,Waterberg National Park

We saw many bogged down who had to be assisted...Too many tourist buses to see the sunrise. We went there around 10:00 and by 12:00 there was no one left.

cielward,"Reading, United Kingdom",You need to be a keen student of history,"The rock carvings are, as is to be expected, fairly crude.  Their interest lies in how long ago they were scratched into the rock.  It's very hot in the valley and you need to very interested in pre-history to make the trip worthwhile.  The centre sells cold drinks and there are toilets.  You might baulk at using them though, especially if you're a woman.  It might be a World Heritage Site but it's not my kind of thing especially when the temperature is about 35 deg in the shade and some minor rock scrambling is involved.",5-May-15,Friends,Etosha_Pan

Do take the guided tour as the guides are knowledgeable and give an interesting, informative overview of the history of the mining town.  A walk around, on your own, at the end of the tour is a must and is a good photo opportunity.  It is most interesting to see how the sand has taken over and has filled most of the houses. Walking alone through the hospital gives one quite an eerie feeling.  A sun hat and sturdy walking shoes are a recommendation.",21-Apr-17,Friends,Dune 7

I honestly can not praise or recommend this company highly enough. I had done a huge amount of research before choosing this company and we were more than happy with our decision. During the planning stages, the online response was very swift and the office based team (Kady, Chantelle and Carolyn)  offered great support and advice before we selected the final route and they were incredibly helpful. All of the paperwork and information provided in advance was incredibly detailed and very accurate with info on all the carefully selected bespoke accommodation was provided, which was really beneficial.When we arrived in Windhoek we were met by our brilliant guide and Namibian local Jurgens. To say that Jurgens went above and beyond for us during this trip is an understatement. He was so passionate about his country and had almost academic knowledge of the wildlife, history and culture. We were so delighted that we had made the decision to opt for a guided tour rather than a self drive as we felt we would have missed out on a lot of insight and also animal and bird sightings because of Jurgens's eagle eye. Our transport was incredibly comfortable and All of our accommodation options were very varied and so comfortable.Thanks to Jurgens and all the team for the best holiday ever.I would not hesitate to recommend this company.

And yes, it gets quite busy, but it's a major attraction in Africa, so what do you expect -solitude? Our guide was cheeky and knowledgable - I loved her descriptions and the way she interacted with us - asking us questions about what we thought we saw in the images.

Loved every minute!!,"We left it quite late to book our trip to Namibia and were struggling to get accommodation so we contacted Namibia Tours to see if they could sort it out for us.  Chantelle did a sterling job of finding accommodation for us and we stayed in some amazing places.  There was only one lodge we would not go to again but the rest were fabulous.  We would have loved to stay in a couple of the lodges for longer but considering we didn't book till the end of January for an April trip Namibia Tours did a fabulous job.  We even stayed in the honeymoon suites of a couple of the lodges which was a real treat!Apart from a couple of small issues before we left which were easily rectified everything was great.  From the moment we arrived in Namibia the trip went brilliantly.  The car hire company were efficient, the guide Carlo who met us at our hotel on our first evening to give us all the lodge vouchers and other info was a great character and really helpful.We absolutely loved Namibia!

She responded very quickly to all our mails and we got a truly amazing itinerary. We also booked our car through NTS and had no problems at all with it. Not even a puncture in 29 days on the roads of Namibia. The car was brought to the B&B we stayed at in Windhoek and we got an excellent introduction to it by Wayne. Estella from NTS also dropped by the B&B and gave us some advice on our trip. During our trip Bianca even helped us get the activities booked. All in all NTS offers an outstanding service and I cannot recommend them enough.

ClicknNomad,"Perth, Australia",Amazing Landscape,"Sitting next to much famous salt pan Sossusvlie, Deadvlei is actually what you find most photos - the dead camel thorn trees dead in the white clay pan against the red sand dune.Getting there: one (1) hour drive along the 62KM tarred road from the NWR Sossusvlie gate till the start of the 5KM loose sand road to the drop off point of Deadvlei (dropping tires to 1.5kpa not required if you have experience driving in thick loose sand!!). Definitely requires a 4x4 for the sand drive or NWR has a regular transfer service at a charge. The walk/hike is 1.1KM and would take 15-20mins through thick desert sand at times. Can hike the Big Momma and descend down to Deadvlei.Key info: unless you camp at the NWR camp site or lodge at Soss Dune lodge, entrance and exit times at the Sossusvlie NWR gate is limited between sun rise and sun set. If you are there for quality photos, arrange to stay within NWR camp or Sossus Dune lodge (upto US$500 a night during high season)and leave 1-1.5 before sun rise and arrive 1-1.5 hours after sunset. (If you arrive after gate close at sunset you might get a fine US$50). The closest lodge outside of the park is Sossusvlie Lodge (US$350-450) right next door (entry and exit times apply).Wear: definitely closed shoes as the sand can be abrasive and quite hot during mid day (did observe few people with no shoes or sandals). The shoes will get filled with sand as you hike. Loose clothing is fine but during the cold windy winter a jumper could be handy.Things To Take: camera with a fully charge battery and a lot of imagination for angles for photographs. Plenty for water if you expect to spend the day.Go either early in the morning or around 2.30pm giving enough time to exit the gates. A must visit in Sossusvlie!!",18-Jul-17,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

Being in the abandoned town by ourselves really gave us the sense of being swallowed up by the sands. Its was haunting and beautiful the way the house still stood in silence, slowly filling up with sand- I loved it! It also means we got to stay until sunset and watch the shadows grow and the sunbeams touch the wallpapered walls. Although, I feel we did miss out on the knowledge I am sure a tour guide would have imparted- there is very little written information so you don't get the full understanding of each building.

Don't miss it, they said.  They were not wrong.  Really, this was an incredible trip.  The most important part of the trip was Janine Reichstein at Namibia Tours and Safaris, who responded almost instantaneously with up to date information and who organized the dates and selected the accommodations perfectly.  She is prompt, professional, and friendly.  We stopped in to meet her in person, we liked her so much.  We went in a small 10-person bus, with a guide/driver Holger Klose, speaker of German, English, Afrikaans, and other languages.  He has an encyclopedic knowledge and was constantly updating and comparing notes with other guides he encountered, to locate exactly where and what time to find the lions, for example, and to ensure we were as early as possible at the red dunes of Sossusvlei before the sun got too high in the sky.  He heroically rose before all of us, was ready with the bus at 6 a.m. almost every day, and got us to to where we should be carefully and cautiously.  We loved his company and we will keep up with him for years.  Do not miss Namibia.  The colors, the animals, the natural beauty, the people, the cultures, all of it is spectacular.

If I had to do it all over ago, I would give it a pass.  It is nothing more than etchings on rocks made by natives to depict the sources of water (now long gone) and the use of rocks like a school chalk board to depict various animals. Most all of the rocks seem the same so it is useless to climb to the tope to see more of the same. The weather was hot and the gift shop was full of dirty and tacky merchandise.

Dallas,"Dallas, TX",Notable effort but poor safari experience.,"We came here expecting a real safari to see cheetahs. We had hoped for education about cheetahs as well. But what we experienced in the first hour was nothing but a photo op with three rescued pet cheetahs and reluctant answers to questions. This is the worst of bad tourism. The place seems to be doing good things for rescuing the animals, but is not doing the right thing for visitors. People were taking selfies and petting these cats, because they could, and not learning about wild animals at all. We asked to be taken back to our cabin. We spoke with others who continued on for a second hour, and the rest of the drive on a stand-up flatbed was to an area where food is put out so the cheetahs would come. There was no further instruction, we were told. Again, this is hardly a safari. As for accommodations, the cabin we had was comfortable, with a nice bathroom. There is no electricity for charging or phone service anywhere on the ranch. However, we were bothered in the evening by a high powered light pole shining directly on our patio.

And we have to say it was the right decision! Janine helped us a lot during the planning, answering all our questions quickly and detailed, as well as being very flexible in adapting the offer and itinerary tour our requests. Then, during the trip, everything was perfect, the lodges, the restaurants she recommended us, and the capability to help us with unexpected issues (we had a last minute flight cancellation to go from Namibia to Botswana, and they were able to help us right away with other options to continue the trip w/o problems and extra costs). We took the option to travel with a drive/guide through Namibia, and although I preferred to do a self-drive trip, I have to admit that it was an excellent choice. The guide/driver we had, Nico, was really good and nice. He had very good knowledge about all the flora and fauna not only from Namibia, but from other regions of Africa. Also, he explained us a lot of things about Namibia, its history, the people, traditions, culture, situation, etc., and he did it always with respect, humor and a smile. He was always willing & ready to help. We had a very good time with him, and for us it was not anymore our driver/guide, but another friend of the group.

I recommend getting up to the top of the hill and climbing up on the reservoir walls.If you're here for photography, buy the photographer's pass straight up.We weren't sure how long we would stay, so ended up paying twice and staying for 4 hours.

There is even a part of the road with deep sand, so do NOT jump on the brake but give more power and hope that nobody is coming your way.

Very doable to do Twyfel, Organ Pipes and Burnt Mountain all in the space of our 3 hours.But Twyfel is the major spot where you will need a Damara guide that can give you the necessary knowledge and if your lucky some of the local lingo to go with it. Being thousands of years old, suffering from drastic climate change, and the introduction of David Levin are just some of the key facts that were brought to our minds from our informative guide.The whole area is marvellous and seems like a cross of half mountain and half desert, but how the rocks are formed and   communication displayed through the paintings really is awesome. Must say that it was very hot coming here in the middle of the day, so plenty of water and be prepared for a bit of hiking around the grounds led by the guide. If the guideâs info is too overwhelming at times, then itâs easy to catch up by observing the useful diagrams and facts located in the shaded museum to the right of the reception.

Got to keep in perspective that this was our first self drive experience, so we didnât want to hog all our time here and not travel through the park. We just kept viewings before brekkie and after dinner, with the rest of our time spent in the park. We saw many people fixated with the waterhole, but there are great opportunities to be had with the use of personal energy and desire to get what you came for in the first instance, but we understand the luxury of animals arriving while you sit back and take a pew. The area consists of lots of seating, lots of people and lots of silence. But the more people present then silence seems to become more difficult even if it does benefit the welcoming of animals. Though visiting January low season, we still managed to see many elephants, black rhinoâs, zebras, wildebeests, warthogs and various types of antelope.

DanielD525,"London, UK",The 700 million years old pointed dome...,"We left Dune 7 and headed straight for Spitzkoppe which was a 2 hour drive and most of the journey hugged the B2 road. Admission was 185 nad for 2 pax and a vehicle with a further 55 nad to be paid for the guide, but that was to be paid later once you see the bridge, formations, bit of climbing and then come back to collect the guide in your vehicle so he can show you the rock paintings on staff only tracks. So basically you can only see the paintings with a guide. But there is so much else to discover, too much in fact which is why an overnight stay here is best option rather than what we done and cram it into a day. But this was our only option due to the rest of our arranged itinerary that laid ahead.We were given a map from reception so we could start our own self drive tour on the gravel road and make pit stops when we wanted. The road was not too hard to navigate on, but slow is the key as some of these stunning rock formations and boulder sizes are breathtaking. There are many different routes to hike in and around the rocks and incorporating awesome views of the whole Spitzkoppe location. The money shot is the bridge, where people must think â how did that happenâ? Hardly any other visitors here which always feels great wherever in the world you are. After our self drive, we return to reception to pick up our guide and he takes us to the bushman paintings that were in 3 locations and they tell their own impressive story. The paintings are between 2-4000 years old and were a remarkable way of communication when technology didnât exist.

Once dropped off the magic then happens, with a walk of about 1 km towards the clay pan and alongside Big Daddy. In the heat itâs a tough walk with hardly any shade, but totally worth seeing this unique site that probably is the face of the country besides Etosha. Once your standing inside the clay pan your surrounded by dead trees about 600 years old and dunes everywhere you turn, which gives you a little bit of a feel of being in a stadium with other players and the crowd watching over you.

My visit was during the 'low season' and I was quite surprised how busy it was - I fear the high season will be very crowded - so suggest you plan accordingly.My understanding is Namibia's tourist high & low seasons are basis school holidays in Europe & South Africa - and not that of any weather seasons in Namibia.

David S,"Hemel Hempstead, UK",Unique and awesome,"You have probably seen the dunes on TV and documentaries, but believe me, to see them and climb them in real life is amazing.Get there really early, when the sun rises the colours of the dunes change, as do the shadows, you can take 3 photos of the same scene over a 30 minute period and they will all look different. To get there early you need to stay nearby, I stayed at the Le Mirage lodge, exceptional accommodation and food, and only 21km from the dunes. Take plenty of water, be prepared to climb the dunes for great views, the paths along the dunes are quite narrow, with what seems sheer drops either side. But remember, even if you did fall, it's only very soft pure sand.",28-May-14,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole

That was the best decision we could have made.  Henk Marais, our guide, turned out to be an encyclopedia of knowledge on every question posed to him and ensured that we had vegetarian meals at every lodge.  He was also able to advise us on which optional tours might be suitable and of interest to us when we were in Swakopmund.  All overnight lodges were of a high standard.  Tanya from Namibian Tours also arranged a hot air balloon trip for us which turned out to be a most awe inspiring flight.

DawnFryer,"Johannesburg, South Africa",A worthwhile visit with knowledgeable guides.  Not easy to access though.,"We arrived at the site at 4pm, driving a normal sedan on surprisingly well maintained dirt roads, expecting to be told that the last tour had left already.  However, we paid and were given a guide to tell us about the engravings (apparently if you arrive at 4.30 or later, you will be able to access the site but will not have a guide.  Pointless - you really need the guide.) Our guide's name was Sylvia, and she was knowledgeable, clever, funny and well spoken.  She explained about the engravings which are 6000 years old and a Unesco World Heritage Site, and answered each of our questions happily. When she didn't know something, she admitted this, which was refreshing.  The engravings themselves are on large rocks on the side of a mountain.  Sylvia mentioned that she had had 2 x 70 year olds that morning, that had to turn back because the path is precarious. If you are not feeling strong and able to hike up some rocks with loose stones, I would sit this one out.  However, if there is any possibility of your making it, it is well worth the trip. The site is well cared for and clean, and clearly a source of pride for the local people.   The beauty of the mountain and surrounding area is amazing.  And the thought of people sitting engraving these rocks 6000 years ago is mind boggling.",29-Sep-15,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole

The nice thing is that prices were fixed so you didn't have to haggle with each vendor for a good deal, and you didn't have vendors following you down the isle pushing their wares onto you.  And pricing seemed very fare so you never felt like you were over paying.  There was a particularly awesome leather goods dealer with some amazing purses made from wild game leather and fur.

The most fun, however, was going down.

debndon,"Phoenix, AZ",Challenging for Amateur Photographers,"This former diamond mining town, turned into a ghost town attraction when the headquarters were relocated to the mouth of the Orange River and the sand took over the abandoned buildings, is worth the stop if you are in the area. Itâs supposed to be a delight for photographers, but it is definitely challenging for amateur photographers. The dark passages combined with the intense light streaming through the windows make it difficult to work with. Some suggest getting a photographerâs pass in Luderitz the night before your visit and getting to the sight at sunrise. We were staying in Aus and arrived at the site when it opened at 8:00. We still had morning light but it was a little too harsh for certain scenes.For those interested in the history of the town there are guided tours at 9:30 and 11:00 but you are also free to wander around and explore on your own. On other blogs and forums there seems to be some confusion as to the opening hours and if you can buy permits onsite. At the time of our, visit September 2021, the posted hours were 8-1pm with tours offered at 9:30 and 11:00. You can buy permits on the premises.

The Lonely Planet write up says that with a mix of more recent forgeries it is difficult to say how old or authentic some of the carvings really are. These are carvings where the lighter top layer of stone has been scrapped off to form shapes, generally animals, whereas at Brandberg there are actual paintings, some using 5 colors. Our guide Raymond was more entertaining than factual. The trail leads from the reception area to a rock face, a short walk but it does involve some scrambling on rocks. There are staircases to reach the higher carvings. Despite the less authentic vibe of the rock art I found the setting quite pretty with dark rocks, gray plant life and valley views.

It offers newer overnight lodging with an excellent breakfast & dinner included. I would recommend 2 nights and sign up in advance for a full day of activities. They offer behind the scenes experiences: early morning cheetah run, cheetah feeding (2pm weekdays/12n weekends) and afternoon safari drive with sundowner where we saw giraffe's, leopard, oryx, serval, jackals, aardvark and so much more (advance reservations are definitely required!). At dinner we were lucky enough to meet the founder, Dr. Laurie Marker, who started CCF and is the top cheetah expert in the world.CCF also offers exposure to their program of breeding Anatolian Shepard livestock guard dogs which they provide to local farmers to protect their animals from predators (so they don't shoot cheetahs). CCF also has a goat milk dairy where they produce excellent chevre, feta and other cheeses, fudge, etc and help educate farmers how to get the most money out of their goat herds.CFF works to re-wild cheetahs whenever possible and we saw some of their successes in the Erindi Game Reserve. The cheetahs you see at CCF have been saved from a variety of situations which make them unsuitable for reintroduction to the wild so they become ambassadors to the public (eg: mother was killed and cubs became too accustom to humans, the animal was permanently injured, etc).All of the tourism profits go to cheetah conservation efforts so we felt great about visiting and supporting this important organization!",20-May-19,Couples,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve

Devendra A,"Clearwater, FL",Namibia and Botswana flying safari,"Jennifer from Namibia Tours and Safari's did a fantastic  job putting together our 12 day trip Starting in Windhoek. The small plane flights by Wings over Africa were a great way of covering the long distances in relative comfort. The pilots were extremely competent and knowledeable of the destinations. First  we visited Etosha and stayed at Onguma the fort which was a wonderful lodge, with excellent facilities and service. Wildlife was plentiful even at the lodge. watering hole. We then flew to Serra Cafema on the Namibian / Angolan border, a very remote and picturesque location. The experience of meeting with the women of the Himba people by 21st centuary quadbikes was surreal.  Next stop after  fying down the stunning Skeleton coast was  Soussevlei. The Soussevlei lodge was also in a stunning location again with impeccable service and accomodations.  The Safaris and trip to the dunes were outstanding the guides were excellent. Our next stop was in Okovango at Camp Moremi which while not a high end lodge was good and and again had excellent service and staff. Our safari's  for animal viewing  in the park were not as productive as we had hoped, we barely saw lions, (in the distance briefly), but did see a Leopard in a tree and black rhino's close up. Elephants, giraffe, Zebra and other antelopes etc were plentiful. Our penultimate stop was on the Chobe river where Jennifer had arranged a houseboat for us. Which I was a little apprehensive about as there was not much written about them. It turned out to be the best vantage for wildlife viewing for the whole trip!. On the first afternoon from the water we saw huge herds of elephants in the Chobe park (Botswana side of the river). That same evening we saw a large family of lions watching the sunset from the river bank and had a fantastic siting of a leopard walking along the bank for several minutes. Not to mention the crocs and hippos. The morning and evening small boat trips from the house boat got us fairly close to the wildlife (safely). On our last day we saw hundreds of elephants large and small crossing the river to get to the grass on the islands in the river for a change of diet from trees. THe babie elephants were swimming and using trunks as snorkels. The last stop after a 90 minute drive from Chobe into Zimbabwe was the Victoria falls hotel at Victoria falls. A very well run run and best located of the hotels for viewing the falls. Which were off course stunning, A great trip planned by Jennifer.",20-Aug-15,Family,Namutoni

We showed up to a large Rhino having a long drink while off in the distance a Giraffe was patiently waiting for his turn.  When the Rhino finally walked away another Rhino was approaching from the same direction, they had a lengthy snorting match but they seemed to agree to disagree and let each other pass without incident.  We also saw several Kudu, Hyena's, Jackals and Zebra's.  Pretty amazing site seeing from the edge of a campground.  Highly recommended.  Make sure to turn off your flash at night (just use night settings) and please be as quiet as possible.  Enjoy.",4-Jun-19,Couples,Waterberg National Park
Devora T,"Haifa, Israel",all went smoothly according to all our expectations,"We (3 people) just returned from our 3 weeks self drive tour in Namibia. We are very glad that we arranged most of the tour, including the car, through Edward Talor from Namibia Tours & Safaris. He made our stay more comfortable, safe and economic, like airport trasfer and included dinners in most of the lodges, a 2nd spare tyre and GPS. We had a new 4X4 Nissan double cabin which allowed us to drive to the dunes and feel safe in any rough road. We even helped a himba family to carry there water from a small spring and ran away from an elefent. As we drove almost 4000 km, mostly on dusty unpaved roads, the car is very important. We chose middle rang lodges and they were all fine. It was good that we could always reach Edward or a representative in case of trouble or changes. We defenetly used this option, althoughnot in the weekends. Devora",23-Oct-14,Friends,Namib-Naukluft National Park

Take lots of water as well. And finally, it is OK to climb in boots. We did that and we didn't have any issues. Bear in mind that to get to the dune ""trailhead"" from the main parking lot, you have to traverse a morass of sand that only 4x4 can handle. Don't be stupid by attempting to drive the2.5 mile of deep sand in a small car (we did see a few beached cars on the way.) If you are not up to it or you are not athletic enough to walk the distance or you don't have a 4x4, cough up the NAD 200 (or whatever it is) and get a ride on a tractor trailer.",1-Oct-18,Couples,Namib-Naukluft National Park
Dewald R,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Gem of Etosha,"The Okaukuejo Waterhole is, in my opinion, the gem of the Etosha National Park. It is the perfect spot to observe a wide variety of animals from up close and it is very impressive how you are almost guaranteed of great sightings. One of the things I really like is how there are benches spread all around the waterhole ensuring you can sit and relax as well as have clear views of the animals. Some of the benches also have shade which is great for those hot days. What makes the Okaukuejo Waterhole even better is it is just a short walk from most of the accommodation options at the Okaukuejo Resort, including the camping area. This means that you can spend an entire day at the waterhole and enjoy animal sightings without having to ever leave the resort. Over and above all of this, the highlight for me is the mesmerizing sunsets at the waterhole, truly what African dreams are made of. If you are planning to visit the Etosha National Park, then definitely make some time to pop over to the Okaukuejo Waterhole, you wont be disappointed.",19-Dec-23,Friends,Namutoni
Dewald R,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Experience Of A Life-time,"If you are planning a trip to Sossusvlei, your first stop will be the Sossusvlei 4x4 Parking Area. At the parking area, there are ablution facilities as well as the option of taking 4x4 taxis to the vlei itself. While you can drive your own 4x4, I highly don't recommend it, unless you're a seasoned sand specialist. The intense traffic (mostly taxis and lodge vehicles) combined with the unforgiving sandy surface can make navigating the last part to the vlei quite challenging. During my visit, I even saw two vehicles get stuck. Once you arrive at the vlei, the true beauty of the area opens up with dunes surrounding you on all sides. I visited the Deadvlei as well as summited the Big Daddy Dune (both reviewed separately) and can highly recommend both. If you are planning on doing the Big Daddy and Deadvlei, I do recommend first summiting Big Daddy as you have to walk back through the Deadvlei to reach the parking area again. Sossusvlei is a must-see in Namibia. Its uniqueness and beauty will leave memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. Definitely and experience of a life-time!",1-Feb-24,Friends,Namutoni
Dewald R,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Achievement,"The Big Daddy Dune in Sossusvlei is massive, and I completely underestimated it. The climb was quite difficult, as it's dune sand all the way from the bottom to the top. We took it slow (just over an hour to the summit) and often paused to rest and take in the views. Reaching the top is definitely worth it as a sense of achievement washes over you. From here, you have breathtaking views of Sossusvlei, as well as the seemingly endless sea of dunes stretching out before you. To descend, you have multiple options, with most opting for the straight down route towards Deadvlei. We ended up deciding to go straight down and it was a lot of fun, and very exhilarating as you move quite quickly. It is however good to note that this option is potentially risky and not for everyone. At the bottom, we headed back through Deadvlei towards the main Sossusvlei area. If you're planning on visiting Deadvlei as well, I highly recommend climbing Big Daddy first. I have climbed multiple dunes in the past, but Big Daddy was special. It was one of the highlights of my trip through Namibia and something I will never forget!",5-Feb-24,Friends,Namutoni
Dewald R,"Cape Town Central, South Africa","Natural Beauty, Human Shortcomings","Dune 7 is a must-visit if you are in the Swakopmund-Walvis Bay area as it is an iconic and beautiful natural wonder to behold. The climb itself isn't too strenuous if you take it slow and start at the longer side from the left of the Dune. It is definitely worth it when you reach the top and are able to take in the amazing views of the surrounding area. It is good to note that there is an entrance fee now for all visitors, even if they don't plan on climbing the dune. When I visited, the fee was N$ 100 per person for those from SADC countries, but I have to say it has contributed to the overall safety of the area. If you aren't planning on climbing the Dune you can still take in it's beauty from the parking area outside the gate. I was however disappointed with the overall cleanliness of the area. The area at ground level of the Dune was dirty with lots of small litter spread around, and the bathrooms were dirty as well. The staff were also very lacklustre. They weren't very helpful or friendly and gave the impression that they didn't really want to be there. Given that an entrance fee is now being charged, I think the staff could do a better job of keeping the area clean. Overall, I would have given Dune 7 a 3 out of 5, however I always enjoy visiting and climbing it and definitely think it is still a must visit.",27-Nov-23,Friends,Namutoni

First time was a quick stop as they close early on weekends, even a Saturday, so I just looked round a small area.  It is much larger inside than you think.  The shops/stalls I saw had typical magnets, t-shirts etc.  They did also have beautiful handmade wooden christmas tree ornaments eg santa on a cheetah, but you need to be aware that these are a high price.I then went back midweek and was able to see all the shops inside and can report that there is an extensive range of goods, many of which I did not see elsewhere in Namibia eg good quality t-shirts, beautiful sand picture plates, batik style homewares such as oven gloves, art made using pieces of leather (these pictures are wonderful and a fair price), hand carved bowls and spoons, leather souvenir notebooks and so much more.  The cafe is also well worth a try even if just for the large slabs of cake!Shops outside were not souvenir focused.

The contrasts of sand dune, sky, clay pan and the few darkened dead trees was a visual experience I will never forget. The photo opportunities are endless with the changing light of the day.  Bring water and it is a little chilly when you begin your ascent up the dunes before sunrise - so perhaps an extra shirt or light windbreaker may be handy.  I carried a very light small day pack for my wind breaker, protein bar, camera batteries, water and that was it and it was sufficient.  The total in/out up dune 45 and descending into dead vlei was just a few hours. Afterwards, my guide drove us to a park area nearby for some coffee and mid morning snack.

DnSGlobeTrotters,Mauritius,Striking scenery,Deadvlei is a unique landmark that is definitely a must visit when you are in the Sossusvlei region. The scenery of the stark tree trunks and branches with the backdrop of red sand dunes is breath-taking. Bring one or more cameras and capture the amazing scenery which will likely be engraved in your memory forever. The vlei is hidden and you will need to walk for about 20 minutes to reach it from the car park.

doc_renata,"Melbourne, Australia",Fantastic African experience - Excellent service,"We booked our 3 week African adventure across Namibia and Botswana with Namibia Tours & Safaris and we certainly werenât disappointed.  We always try to engage a local company and this one provided us with an exceptional service.  Although we had in mind a list of places we wanted to visit, Wilmari (our travel consultant) gave us heaps of good advice and recommendations.  She helped us preparing a great itinerary taking into account our needs and budget.Our accommodations, a combination of lodges and camps, were all very good and each location offered us a new and pleasant surprise, let it be a very stylish room, an amazing view or both orâ¦. just an elephant visiting us at nightâ¦ like in Mapula Lodge (Botswana).  Food was absolutely great (real fine dining) and plentiful.In Namibia we travelled from Windhoek to Kalahari, Fish River Canyon, Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, Damaraland, Etosha National Park and Western Caprivi.  As a travelling group of 6 adults we knew we wanted a comfortable car with a local driver and a guide and we were very lucky to have an excellent one.  Augustinus, our champion guide/driver was very knowledgeable and took us to locations we would have never found on our own.  He was very helpful and took extremely good care of us.  It was particularly important when one of us had to face very unexpected but serious medical issue requiring hospital admission.  We wouldnât have been able to cope without Agustinus and Wilmari.  They were available, responsive, very helpful and very, very supportive.  Thank you so much Guys!!!After crossing the border to Botswana by car two of us continued our African adventure by flying from Maun to incredible Okavango Delta and then to Chobe National Park.  All transfers and trips went very smoothly making it an amazing and absolutely unforgettable experience!!! Thank you again NTS, particularly Wilmari, for making our African adventure truly wonderful, safe and memorable.

His sense of humor, patience and kindness helped make the trip perfect!Each hotel was so unique with yummy food - my favorites were the Desert Homestead Outpost in the Namib Desert (5 course fabulous meals) and lovely little cabins with sleeping roof to view stars and outdoor shower ! and the Mowani Mountain Camp with incredible scenery, awesome cabin and food, and fabulous sunset views from the hill above the lodge.  All other accomodations were wonderful also - but those 2 definitely stuck out.I loved the mix of seeing landscapes (the Dunes in the Namib Desert in the early AM and the water holes in Etosha were simply breathtaking), cultural activities (Himba and Damara tribes - fascinating language with clicking, etc. and music from the Damaras), history (pictographs and petrified forest in Damaraland), animals (loved the desert elephants, and zebras and giraffes in Etosha) - such variety and all superb.I would highly recommend this agency to anyone planning a trip to Africa/Namibia.",18-Feb-19,Friends,Waterberg National Park

Terrific voice and piano player too.  What an interesting town.  Many of the hotels offer guided tours here, but if you just turn up in time for either the 9.30am or 11am tour, it is much cheaper at the gate.

Dr Charles Andr... C,"Darwin, Australia",Our introduction to Namibia - a great success!,"Our 12-day Self-Drive Safari was undertaken by Susan and me, from Darwin, Australia, our younger son, Calum, his partner, Viola, and their daughter, Amara, from Tallinn, Estonia, and our youngest daughter, Isobel, and her partner, Kevin, from Leeds, England, 27th June - 8th July, 2017.   The venture was organised for us over two years or so by Tanya Coetzee.   The safari's organisation was exceptional, overall and with respect to discrete arrangements, such as accommodation, briefings on vehicles and our route and schedule, collection and return of vehicles and the sat-'phone.   When Susan became ill, Tanya referred her to her GP, in Swakopmund, with whom consultation was readily effected.   Understatement, friendliness and efficiency were key to all such matters, and the personnel involved were without exception courteous, considerate and effective.Accommodation arranged for us was excellent, although Susan and I found our room at Mushara Bush Camp a bit chilly, even with extra blankets.Nothing was too much bother for staff.   I had neglected to alert Tanya to my mobility limitations .   These, not anticipated, were always dealt with efficiently, considerately and with no fuss.   The dignified courtesy, consideration and efficiency of staff, no matter what issue arose, stood out in the hospitality we experienced.Landscapes, sunrises and sunsets throughout were memorable - spectacular and varied, generally remarkable.   The wild-life of Damaraland and Etosha National Park provided our most fulfilling experiences, of course.   We were fortunate with the guides we had in game-spotting drives - capable, sensitive and knowledgeable, and distinctly more skilled and patient than counterparts whom we observed.   In consequence, in Damaraland we had extended close experience of desert-adapted elephants - a bull nuzzled my elbow  through an open window - and observation of a wondrous array of animals, again at close quarters, in Etosha.   With the latter, it was considered the game-spotting vehicle would have been difficult for Susan and me, so we drove in convoy.   Here, lions and giraffes performed superbly, as did kudu and gemsbok and everything else, especially when we returned in the afternoon.We had two reservations:   performance of personnel on the Etosha gates;   and irresponsible, inconsiderate conduct of drivers in some other visiting vehicles.A warning:   leave plenty of time to drive back to Windhoek on he final afternoon.",25-Jul-17,Family,Dune 45

DrobboEssex_England,"Essex, England",Namibia Highlights Tour Sense of Africa,"I have recently returned from a highlights tour of Namibia. Let me say that this young country is ticking all the right development boxes. Embedded in itâs constitution are principles of conservation. It is a vast country with a relatively small population but they understand how to look after what they have and to a large extent put the established developed nations to shame. There is little or no litter even in the centres of population. The people are courteous and apparently generally happy with their lot. I did not witness homeless people or people begging on the streets which is symptomatic of the âdevelopedâ nations of the world. It was genuinely a pleasure to be there.BUT - - We booked through an online travel agent in the UK with a company called âSense of Africaâ.There were two tour options available - Classic or Superior. The Superior package was in groups of up to 4 people and with all meals included but was considerably more expensive than the Classic package which was for groups up to 30 people but no meals included. I discussed these options with our UK agent and decided to buy the Classic package on the basis that the meals were not very expensive (Â£12 -Â£15 for a three course dinner) but more importantly for me the vehicles used for these trips were potentially bigger and better equipped to deal with Namibiaâs gravel roads.We were picked up at Windhoek Airport in a minivan for just the two of us and I made a point of asking the driver whether this was the vehicle we would be travelling in for the trip. He assured me that this type of vehicle is only used for âtransfersâ. We arrived at the Safari Court Hotel in Windhoek for a one night pre-tour stay and I was impressed by the quality of the accommodation.From thereon I became less impressed by the quality of the tour product. I had to chase up information on the pick up time the following day but I thought that was a minor glitch.The following morning we were picked up at the appointed time in a similar minivan which I had been told was only used for âtransfersâ and this time there were three others in the vehicle (four including the driver). I again asked whether this was the vehicle we would be travelling in for the rest of the tour and he assured me that we would be transferred to another vehicle at the first nightâs stop. The person who drove us was not very forthcoming with any information and he in fact turned out just to be a driver âtransferringâ us to the first nightâs stop. We then met the driver/guide and he introduced us to two more people who would be joining the group - so we were now six (seven including the driver). Imagine my consternation when the following morning we were shown to our tour vehicle which was a similar minivan (only used for transfers) but with a broken window which let in dust and drafts. This was just exactly what I had sought assurance would not happen when I booked the trip with the UK agent and was told by the agent that Sense of Africa provided vehicles offering relative comfort for this tour.We suffered this for a couple of days and all the others on the trip were becoming dissatisfied with what was provided. Legroom in the back of this vehicle was a lot less than I have experienced on a Ryanair flight to such an extent that you had to sit sideways to prevent your knees from pressing up against the seat in front and we were stuck with this for another six days bouncing around on Namibiaâs gravelled roads. Seated at the back I could not hear the commentary provided by the guide even though it was amplified.We reached our second destination Swakopmund to be told that a further two people would be joining the group. So we were now eight people (nine including the driver) bouncing around in a cramped noisy dusty vehicle. The guide was aware of the broken window but did not appear to make any effort to effect any repair and I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy some sticky tape to at least seal the gap to prevent drafts and dust. At the same time complaining to Sense of Africa and to my UK travel agent.I give the benefit of the doubt to our guide who had apparently requested another vehicle but was told none was available.With the introduction of two more people to the group travelling conditions became much more uncomfortable and others in the group were now seeking assurances from Sense of Africa that something would be done.Finally we were advised that they would provide bespoke game drive vehicles for our time in Etosha National Park otherwise we would have been doing game drives in the back of a minivan with limited window openings which would have been absolutely unacceptable.I have composed this five days after returning to the UK in order that I put things properly into perspective but I am still angry at the way we were treated and even more so when party of about 12 German tourists who were on the same itinerary were provided with a much larger, longer wheelbase vehicle with large windows. To add insult to injury this group were also âupgradedâ to bespoke game drive vehicles when in Etosha because they learnt that we had been.If anyone is considering booking this tour I recommend that you get written assurance that your tour vehicle will be fit for purpose because ours was not and it has taken the edge of what was supposed to be a memorable trip. It was memorable but for entirely the wrong reasons and although Sense of Africa provided us with bespoke game drive vehicles for our time in Etosha I consider that to be merely a gesture of goodwill which canât have amounted to anything more than Â£100 per person for our group  - a very cheap outcome for them.

We were thinking of driving between destinations, which is what many people do, but Tanya at Namibia Tours & Safaris sold us on the idea of doing a fly-in safari.  Though more expensive, it was not outrageously more expensive.  It allowed us more time at the 3 main destinations: the Namib Desert (Sossusvlei), Skeleton Coast (Swakopmund), and Etosha. The scenery from our ""private"" Cessna flying over the sand dunes and along the skeleton coast was simply amazing! The pilot, Matthias, became like a friend to us during the 8 days.  Professional, friendly, courteous.   The places we stayed at (Desert Homestead Outpost, Swakopmund Guest House, and Onguma Tree-Top Camp) were magical... especially the Outpost and Tree-Top camp, where the rooms give you the feeling that you are alone in some of the most magnificent nature on the planet.  The hospitality at the lodges, including the food, was outstanding, and the wildlife experiences were amazing.  We saw everything we could have hoped to have seen.

All of the accommodations and excursions organized by NTS for our trip were well run and organized.   We particularly enjoyed the Mowani Mountain Camp, Dolomite Camp, and Onguma Bush Camp both for fantastic locale, hotel and guide service, and variety of wildlife.   Self-drive was great being at our own pace, however if you are uncomfortable driving long distances on lonely gravel roads be forewarned - Namibia is a large, beautiful and wide open country with extremely low population density.

Of all the houses there is only one you are not allowed to enter as the only thing holding it up is the sand... Apart from that you are welcome to enter the other buildings at your own risk of course. Fascinating to see and picture how this town was when it was full of diamond miners and their wives. Millionaire street with the houses of the mining manager, book keeper and architect. The shopping street with the bakery, butcher and grocery and everyday shop. There's this eerie feeling, especially when you visit the hospital building. The photo opportunities are brilliant. I fell for the taking photos through the open windows - the landscape photos got automatically framed. ;-) This is in the middle of the desert. Fair enough - the sea is not far away but it's amazing what we do for the prospect of getting rich. Join one of the two morning tours to get a better insight in the life of the diamond mining families. There is also a nice cafe and souvenir shop in the main building.

If you go when it is clear with blue skies, you will get some incredible pictures. If you go when it is overcast.... Not quite so much, but still good. I don't know if you have ever climbed sand dunes, but holy cow. It is not easy. Coming from Montana I have done a fair share of hiking on steep terrain. I was not prepared for sand though... One step up, 7/8 step down. Again and again. We made the mistake of not going up along the ridge because I know that would have been easier. Instead we went straight up from the base. Big mistake. If you were ready for it, it wouldn't be a problem, but we were not, and quit partway up to Big Daddy. Going down the dune was incredibly fun and took almost no time, and no effort.One of the best views can be had flying above, and it is truly stunning. By far the prettiest flight of my life was flying in a small plane over the Namib Desert and then up the coast. Incredible.Definitely worth the visit, but a seen it, and moving on kind of thing.

Eastbourne,"Eastbourne, UK",Interesting visit,We choose the walking tour as it suited our budget. The projects main aim is to save the cheetah in the wild. In Namibia farmers have in many cases erroneously blamed the cheetah for killing its cattle and subsequently killed the cheetah.  Work is done to educate farmers and communities. The project also breeds Anatolian dogs which are given to farmers. These dogs move with the cattle and warn the herdsman of any predator  nearby.. Our guide was Job and he provided a clean and interesting background of the project. We also got to see a few cheetah who through circumstances will never be able to go back into the wild. I consider the tour was value for money and very informative. The weather was hot and not much shade but there is a pleasant cafe at the end and the food was good and the drinks cold.,24-Mar-16,Friends,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve

Eddiemack,"Pompano Beach, FL",Riveting Desolation in the Desert!,"Our ship anchored and we tendered ashore to Luderitz where a pre-arranged tour guide awaited. Our objective was to explore the region's past and visit Kolmanskop, a ghost town that was once a bustling center of the diamond trade. The trip to the ghost town took about 15 minutes. In 1908, a railway worker found a diamond in the sand and that started the development of a boomtown that thrived until the end of WWI when diamond sales plummeted and it was abandoned. Walking through the town, it was clear that the exteriors have been scoured by the wind, sand dunes fill the interiors and little remains of the town's former glory. Yet, there is something riveting about the desolation as the desert slowly tries to bury what's left.On the way back to our ship, we stopped at an oyster farm before visiting Goerke House mansion, the Lutheran church and the museum.",1-Mar-16,Friends,Heroes Acre

Edinburgh,"Edinburgh, UK",An unforgettable experience,"We had no idea what to expect from a visit to the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Otjiwarongo, but it was really inspiring to see a number of wild cheetahs up close, without barriers, and to see their acceleration, and the speeds they can turn when only running at something like half their top speed. It was interesting to learn more about why cheetah numbers have declined (only eat fresh prey and tend to back off if challenged by other predators), and about the work of the Fund.  Although the cheetahs were the main event, the Fund does important work to train dogs for sheep/goat herders, so that the flocks are protected and cheetahs are less likely to be killed by the herders and farmers.

They demonstrate on their own farms to other farmers how guard dogs will protect their goats and sheep from cheetahs and other predators. Keeping predators in the wild will reduce competition from antelope eating the farmer's precious pasture. They demonstrate how to milk goats and keep them healthy providing an important source of calcium for farmers kids, rather than just using the meat. 4-they have an education programme for Namibian kids5- they take in local apprentices eg kitchen staff.Many thanks to Brian for working so hard and giving us a very special experience.

elizarenn,"Chattanooga, TN",Alleviate your stress by booking with NTS!,"Thereâs nothing worse than the feeling of stress when itâs time to plan a vacation. Researching places to stay, finding the rental car, choosing the right activities â all of that can make a vacation seem daunting. Namibia Tours and Safaris takes away all of the stress and speculation after you send a simple email explaining what youâd like to do and your preferred level of lodging. The first itinerary we received didnât quite fit our projected dates, so within a couple of days, Sammy at NTS rearranged our tour and added a new lodging to create a better fit for us. Everything was expertly arranged for us before we left, and we were sent our vouchers and a detailed, day-by-day itinerary with pictures, directions, vivid descriptions, historical information, and optional driving routes in case we wanted something a little different. It was great to have space to explore choices. The itinerary offered suggestions of what to do and see along the routes from one lodge / hotel to the next, sites we would probably have missed on our own. (For example, we wouldnât have thought to look for the Tropic of Capricorn sign and stop for a photo!)Upon arrival in Namibia, we were greeted at the airport and taken to meet the NTS representative, who went over the itinerary with us, using a highlighted road map as a visual aid, and she patiently answered our questions. A representative from the rental car company was also there to go over the details of the 4x4 in case we experienced an emergency on the road. The thorough orientation was more than we expected, but it was nice to know that the company had a personal stake in our safety and enjoyment. Little things, like a tote bag with a Namibian wildlife book and face masks to wear in the desert, made the meet-and-greet more special. All of the lodges and hotels were excellent and suited our tastes exactly. NTS, without our prompting, booked activities for us at a couple of our stays, and they were absolutely perfect. We would not have known what to do at those stops â or how much we needed to go on a Sandwich Harbour 4x4 adventure, for example. It was amazing!  At our last hotel, a representative came to pick up the rental car shortly after we arrived, and the next morning our transfer to the airport was right on time. We cannot emphasize enough how happy we are to have booked this vacation through Namibia Tours and Safaris. They eliminated all stress and speculation â and the price was more than reasonable.",11-Sep-23,Couples,Namutoni

An internationally known attraction - this ghost town was originally full of locals and Germans who came because of a diamond rush at Elizabeth Bay mining area in the early 1900s. When the diamonds ceased to be in abundance, many people left to go to other diamond mining booms leaving behind many of their things. The houses are now slowly being eaten away at by the desert wind and sand.Wonderful attraction, unfortunately the caretakers are allowing it to fall apart a bit more than necessary as unsupervised visitors have drawn graffiti on the walls and stolen many original artifacts from the homes. So sad. Great place for photographers and history nerds. There's also a great little studio in the ghost town (Kolmans Studios) where you can buy canvas prints by a local photographer.",21-Sep-16,Business,Okaukuejo waterhole

There's even the old hospital, bowling alley and butchery to explore, some of the original fixtures still in place. Only 15 minutes from Luderitz it really it worth a visit.

As soon as you put a leg on the sand it starts giving way and trapping your foot. It was much harder than we thought. We did get a sense of achievement from completing the climb. There is no hurry. I would recommend avoiding the heat of the day as this makes it harder still.The sand does get hot quite early so I suggest wearing shoes and socks. Finally you can always go up the spine of Dune 7 which is much easier.Coming down felt very safe as your feet sink into the sand making you feel anchored to the dune.There was no shade and I recommend taking water. We took about 40 minutes to get to the top and back doing it in a sensible way",17-Feb-19,Couples,Desert Explores

enrique,"Brussels, Belgium",Great experience. Definitely recommend doing it.,"We (a couple) did a 10-day tour across Namibia and had a fantastic experience.Ahead of the trip WWS provided timely and clear information, being available to reply to any questions we had regarding itinerary, prices, lodges, etc.Once on the trip, the car used for the tour (Ford Ranger) was very comfortable and spacious. The lodges selected were all very nice (see one exception below) and the optional activities proposed in each destination were diverse and fun. Special mention to Rolencia, our excellent guide, who made our trip as easy and comfortable as it gets. She went above and beyond to ensure that we made the most out of it. Her knowledge of Etosha park proved to be very helpful in seeing as much wildlife as possible. She also made the trip very interesting with her vast knowledge about the country, and by engaging in very interesting conversations.I would definitely recommend this agency, and Rolencia as a guide, if you are looking into travelling to Namibia (which you should as it is an amazing destination). The only downside, but which in my view has a rather easy fix, concerns the proposed accommodation in Etosha. We were supposed to stay 3 nights in Halali, but the place is very run down, and also there was not much wildlife around it. So as a suggestion, I would advise to go to for Namutoni (which may be a bit more expensive than Halali). In our case, it made a huge difference and made our Etosha experience a lot nicer as not only the accommodation was much nicer, but also it had plenty of wildlife around it (11 lions, 3 cheetahs, 2 rhinos, plus all the rest).",13-Nov-22,Couples,Waterberg National Park

EverExploring,"Cape Town, South Africa","Another ""something to do see before you die"" African experience","On catching my first glimpse of Dead Vlei, I turned back to my husband who was too low on the gently rising dune to see what I saw and I exclaimed ""wow!"" Dead Vlei is captivating. It's a 1.1 km walk through the soft red sand but it's mostly flat and well worth doing. See my review of the flight of the angels over Victoria Falls some years ago, where I claimed its something to do before you die. Well Dead Vlei is in that league.The sand is coolest in the morning so easier to walk on before it heats up. Shoes with many holes (as are my walking shoes) will get full of sand quickly which means its easier to just take them off or wear your most closed up pair.It's a 60 km drive into Sossusvlei which can take an hour if you go straight there. Stops en route are marked by the km distance in eg at 45km you get Dune 45. We enjoyed climbing this too.At Dead Vlei you need time, so give yourselves ample time to wander around to take it all in. Look out for some greenery which we did not notice in the far distance, lower down. A guide asked us if we had seen this. We had not. The professional guides recommend making a beeline for Dead Vlei and Sossusvlei, to climb Big Daddy overlooking Dead Vlei on the left and to do the stopping (every angle is a photo opportunity) along the way as you exit. But the light changes quickly so grab that photo whilst you can is also advised. Important: take drinking water with you, even if it's cool as the air is as dry as parchment.Am told by a Namibian that the afternoon light is incredible, but by then I would imagine its baking hot. So perhaps an afternoon visit is good in winter and remember you need at least 4 hours. Loved it. Don't skip it.",25-May-13,Couples,Dune 45

Everwoman215,"Philadelphia, PA",Do it now!!!!,"My husband I just returned from our 11-day, self-drive tour and I can't say enough good things about this company.  Ashlee was our tour consultant.  We started planning this trip in 2017 and the intent was to go in 2018.  We had to postpone two years in a row for personal reasons, then one one more time due to COVID.  We had already put a deposit down for the 2018 trip, but we were able to let it ride until we finally got to go in July 2021.  Ashlee stayed in touch the entire time and made all our dreams come true!  I was apprehensive about the self-drive aspect, but the team gave us everything we could have possibly needed including spare tires, GPS, phone with local SIM card, maps, first aid kit, water bottles, and even a little COVID kit with masks, sanitizer, etc.  Despite the fact that we could go hours on the road without seeing another human, I felt safe knowing that we were prepared for anything (it helps that my husband is an excellent driver and I trust him with my life).  We spent 3-5 hours in the car between each destination, which was at times a drag, but we saw things that we would never have seen on our self-drive adventure.  We normally stay in mid-range priced lodging when we travel, but because we waited so long for this one we decided to upgrade.  What a great decision!  After long, hard days on the road, every lodge we stayed in was nothing short of spectacular (I will be reviewing each one individually on their pages).  Namibia was on lockdown during our visit due to COVID , which was a bit of a bummer, but only in the cities.  Tourists were allowed to travel among the regions, while Namibians were not.  If that affected the staffing in the lodges where we stayed, we did not see it.  The staff, chefs, guides, and housekeeping were perfect.  We still got to do all the things we wanted to do, with the exception of a visit to Joe's Beerhouse in Windhoek.Our itinerary was as follows:Windhoek (one night - Galton House)Sossusvlei (two nights - Hoodia Desert Lodge)Walvis Bay/Swakopmund (two nights - Strand Hotel)Damaraland (one night - Camp Kipwe)Etosha National Park (three nights - one night Ongava Lodge, two nights Mushara Outpost)Okonjima (one night - Okonjima Villa)The flights were LONG, but the destination was worth it.PHL - DOH - JNB - WDH Qatar Airlines (would recommend, as long as you pay for extra legroom!)31 total hours inbound51 total hours outboundAshlee and the team left no detail unattended to.  Every location we went to greeted us by name on arrival.  We had a personalized, detailed itinerary booklet that contained everything we needed to know about each town/lodge and the activities that we could do there.  They even gave us a book with all the living things in Namibia so we could identify what we saw along the way!Again, I can't say enough good things about this company.

However they tend to be uncomfortable (bring cushions) and not shaded so you can get broiled during the day, even in July. Heaven help those in Oct. to Mar. The small stand is shaded but seats under 20 and can be awkward to get into when the front row is crowded.There are at least 3 floodlights shining on the waterhole for night viewing but animals photographed after dark have a golden hue from the sodium lights.

fabrimarras,"Brugherio, Italy",Great organization and amazing experience!,"I joined a 3-day tour in February for visiting the Namib desert, starting from Swakopmund and finishing at Windhoek. The tour was locally organized by the agency Wild Dog Safaris. We were 14 people: 12 tourists from all over the world, the namibian tour guide Daniel and the chef Frans. We first visited the flamingos in Walvis bay, then we had a long way accross the desert, some stops at Naukluft Mountains in which Daniel explained the interesting geological history, before stopping at Solitaire to have ice cream (!), drinks and apple pie and taking some pictures in the cars cemetery. We arrived late afternoon in in Sesriem Campsite, very well organized: there is also a bar with cold beers and juices, and you can get safe tap water coming from underground, so you don't need to buy big plastic water bottle in Swakopmund! After relaxing by the swimming pool (!), we climbed a dune to enjoy the beautiful sunset in the desert.The following morning, early wake up to climb Dune 45 and see the stunning sunsrise! Later we visited Deadvley: a unique place in the world! I decided to climb Big Daddy and I saw the breathtaking views of all the area: highly recommended if you are fit enough! After lunch and relaxing around the campsite, when we visited the beautiful Sesriem Canyon. We saw the sunset together with many baboons, then we spent the night under the starry sky.The following morning, a log way to go back to Windhoek, stopping by a green area where we saw many orixes, giraffes and zebras.It was an unforgettable experience and I have so many beautiful memories about this adventure. The guide Daniel was super nice, the chef Frans very professional and prepared also different menu for vegetarians.About Namibia Tours & Safaris: Anja was very professional and provided quick replies for every question, the tour price was the same as organizing direcly with Wild Dog Safaris. The only note for improving the service: I asked for renting a sleeping bag, and in the tour plan there was written that it could be hired, but it was not possible because Namibia Tours & Safaris doesn't have a shop. So I had to take my sleeping bag from home, which takes a lot of space, and later in the Sesriem campsite Daniel asked if I needed a sleeping bag since they had spare! So Namibia Tours & Safaris should have asked Wild Dog Safaris to reserve a sleeping bag for me, this way I would have had more space in my luggage.",5-Apr-20,Couples,Dune 7

Fairlawn,"Fairlawn, OH",The highlight of my trip to Africa,"I've been wanting to visit the CCF for a long time, and this was our reason for going to Namibia.  When you go there you have a variety of activities to choose from.  We got there at 8 AM to see the cheetah run, where you get to see cheetahs run after lures for exercise.  It is a good way to see them go fast, and you are right there in the field with them.  You can also see the cheetah ambassadors, where we got to see two of the cheetahs, learn from the staff, and have your picture taken with them.  Another fun thing to see was feeding time.  Each cheetah gets a hunk of donkey or other meat in its own bowl.  The bowls are put in an enclosed area, and then the cheetahs are let in.  It was great fun watching them run in four at a time for dinner.We also took a tour of the grounds where we could see more cheetahs up close and got to see the model goat farm that they are using to help the farmers in the area.  There we also got to see one of the Anatolian Shepherds that are part of the CCF's program of providing local farmers with dogs to protect their livestock.  This has the benefit of protecting cheetahs, as the farmers aren't so motivated to shoot them if they aren't losing their animals.We learned a lot while at the CCF.

I wasn't told about this in advance and wasn't wearing the right shoes for the distance or the hot sand (it was before 10am and the sand was incredibly hot).Definitely wear closed shoes if possible and a hat, the sun is merciless.To get here you take a shuttle from the sossusvlei parking lot to a specific spot. From that spot you need to walk to dead vlei, 5-10 min walk each way.Seeing it is worth the walk. Great photo opportunities as well.You'll probably need less than 10 minutes here though, unless you're taking a water break or a rest.

The CCF gives you a lot of insight into the conservation challenges of cheetahs. The cheetah run in the morning is providing a great opportunity to see these great cats at speed. Thank you to our guide, Job, for the fantastic sundowner and behind the scenes experience, Dr. Marker and her whole staff for sharing a lot of insight about their organizationâs work around the world, especially Calum, who shared a lot about their farmer and dog programs.A visit at the CCF is recommended for everyone interested in these cats and the protection of these animals, especially if you want to get a better understanding on their conservation effort as an NPO.

Our driver had to stop and help some foreign tourists who had got stuck in the soft sand I. Their 4wd.  The hike up to Deadvlei is tough, the sand is soft and every step feels like 3 if you are of average fitness. The super fit young ones literally ran up the dunes. On getting to the crest of the last dune 1km from the car park, the sweat and tears are rewarded with a magnificent view of the Deadvlei with the fossilised trees believed to have died around 800 years ago, dotted around.  The striking contrast of colour from the blue sky, to the red sand dunes, the white dry vlei bed and the black trees is an unforgettable sight.  I'm so happy that I persevered in the hot midday sun.

The guides were excellent and showed their love and dedication to the cheetahs. no doubt those slim looking cats are under special care and surveillance. The cheetahs that cannot be released, are kept in immense reserve parks, are fed and given all attention by the guides: in fact they looked so cool and good in their habitat, living in groups according their ability to live together. No breeding, hence males are separated from females, as the objective is conservation only. They may be given sometimes injured females that are pregnant, as it was the case when we visited the centre, but as soon as possible they will be released in farm sites if the farmer agrees to !CCF is performing a huge effort to educate farmers, young Namibian people and tourists to the endangered cheetah. Although CCF is a private initiative with donations from everywhere in the world, they work close with the Namibian government.Can we think of such a generous private project for the preservation of a wildlife species in France ?

Froggy2Denmark,Denmark,"Stunning, photographer's paradise, great fun","When you're in Sossusvlei and have limited time you have to choose what you want to do. But a visit to the dunes is a must. We stayed at Desert Quiver Camp, 5 km from the entrance to the national park. Once within the park it's a drive of about 60 km on a very well-paved road to the parking lot and entrance to the dunes. (We skipped Dune 45 and drove on to Big Daddy/Deadvlei). After the 60 km you can leave your car and hop onto the 4x4 vehicles that bring you the last 5 km to the Big Daddy dune and Deadvlei. The last 5 km is quite heavy sand and a sign tells you that you can only drive in with a 4x4 (a heavy fine must be paid if you attempt it without a 4x4). Well, we had a ""small"" 4x4 (Renault Kadjar) and there were quite a few people waiting for the transport vehicles so we decided to try driving in ourselves. We were only a few meters in â and we got stuck in the sand. Two of us got out and pushed and we got ourselves free and drove back out. After looking at the sandy tracks again, we decided to try once more â this time we drove faster and did our best not to stop. But it wasn't always clear which way the tracks went and only because we were lucky and able to drive right behind one of the 4x4 transport vehicles did we make it in. After some fabulous hours (see more below) on Big Daddy and at Deadvlei, we had to return through the sandy tracks. Same strategy: we waited for one of the 4x4 transports and drove right behind it. But despite that, about 1 km before the exit we got stuck! Two other cars were also in trouble and a friendly park ranger (who shook his head looking at our smallish car and our driving skills â or lack thereof!) deflated our tyres, put our car in 4x4 lock â and drove us out. We had to pay a small fee, which we gladly paid! Needless to say, we felt quite stupid â of course we should never had attempted it ourselves. Well, let that be a warning! Unless you have a good-sized 4x4, landcruiser or similar, and know how to drive in really heavy sand, do not attempt it.We walked up Big Daddy â all the way to the top. It's quite heavy going and further than we had thought. It was mid morning â around 10 or 11 a.m. â but there was a nice, cool breeze and it was actually not as hot as we would have thought. Actually quite pleasant â but even so it's hard work trudging upwards in the loose sand. But we had to get the top, of course! Not everybody we saw made it all the way up, but it's well worth the effort. When we got up, we stayed there for quite a while, taking in the stunning views. It's really like nothing else â absolutely amazing. You can see the dune scenery and mountains miles away, and the view down onto Deadvlei and the other white patches (other 'vleis') was incredible. The contrast between the red sand of the dunes and the snow-white 'vleis' is just amazing. If you didn't know it's real, you wouldn't believe it. After a while at the top, we did what we had seen others do â run/glide/jump all the way down. When we were on the way up and saw people doing it we thought it looked a little bit scary. But from the top we could see that it was indeed doable â and it was sooo much fun. It took quite a while to get down â it's quite a distance from the top â and it was exhilarating and great fun to run down, burying your feet in the sand. You could take huge jumps and land softly â it felt almost like flying! We took off our shoes â the sand was quite hot on the surface but cool underneath. Only when we were almost down did the sand get too hot and we put our shoes back on again (I still have sand between the two outer layers of my good hiking shoes â¦ I just can't get it out, but I suppose it's a souvenir from our trip!)Once down, we walked across Deadvlei to the dead trees. Deadvlei is also like nothing else on earth. It's photographers' paradise â really. It was mid-day, so probably the light would have been even better earlier or later but it was still a stunning place. I could have stayed much longer, but my husband and daughter felt it was time to go.People talk about seeing the dunes at sunset or sunrise. But unless you are staying inside the park, this is not possible. The park opens at sunrise and it's a 60 km drive to the dunes. But I suppose if you go to the park at sunrise you can catch the dunes with a low sun. We didn't â like I said above, we were at the dunes around 10 or 11, and it was still fabulous. Nevertheless, I would have liked to go back for a second visit, but we had other plans for the next day (hot-air balloon ride + Sesriem Canyon), so one visit had to do. Anyhow, we were lucky enough because on our last day in Sossusvlei, there were strong winds and nobody could visit the dunes (or fly balloons).By the way, on the way from the dunes to the park exit, we saw oryx, ostrich, jackals, and eagles.",13-Dec-17,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

Full Suitcase,"Antwerp, Belgium",Fantastic place and so quiet + easy to do from Swakopmund,"Just 1.5hrs or so from Swakopmund, Spitzkoppe is easy to do as a day trip, and a very good option if the weather is bad at the coast (it changes quickly once you leave the sea behind you). The area is so beautiful that it would certainly be worth a longer stay, but the only option is camping. It's worth a visit even if you are passing by and only have a few hours to spare.Once off the main road, it's some 30km's of gravel, we had a 4x4, but I think you could do it with a 2WD as well.There are toilet facilities at the entrance gate, and I think you could get something to drink and/ or eat there as well, but there are so many nice places to picnic once inside.There is a small entrance fee, and they encourage you to take a local guide to show you around. With 3 kids, we had no place in our car for the guide though, and went in on our own. You do get a map, but the area is a bit tricky, lots of small roads, crossings, and no good indications, so you might find yourself driving in circles, as we did :) - I think they keep it this way on purpose to encourage you to take the guide.Anyway, the place not to be missed is the Natural Bridge with a wonderful rock arch and beautiful views. You can climb to the arch itself, but be sure to explore the options first - climbing steep rocks is not necessary, you can walk a bit more to the left and take the easy way up. If you are camping, then this would be the place to watch the sunset I think.We also went to the Small Bushmans Paradise. Again, almost no indications, but once there, it is easy to access, just a few steps from the car parking. It's interesting to see rock paintings, even if just a few of them, the kids liked it too. It's a short stop, only 5-10 minutes or so.We also stopped at the Natural Pools, and it turned out to be such a beautiful tranquil place as well.If you do take the guide, you'll probbaly be able to see more and faster, but we were there on our own and didn't see a single person or a car for hours, and it just made the whole experience so much more special. It's really a magical place, and certainly one of our favorites in Namibia.",11-Jun-15,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

gabi282,Austria,SUPERB photography-tour from A to Z,"Only the fact that this was now my 3rd trip with NT&S would be a sufficient comment!!!But I must say this time they have done an extraordinary job as I have contacted them only a few weeks before my arrival end December and had detailed imaginations for photography. I knew in advance where to stay and which activities to add. The only doubt I had was about self-driving as a woman all by myself. Edward did not only come up with all the predefined lodges and activities but also had the excellent solution by flying me first into Wolwedans and hand-over a car to continue the tour as self-driving from there. I still drove about 2.000 kilometers myself and didnât have any problem at all. Although I learned how to deflate or blow up tires I have never had the opportunity to do anything myself as the Namibian are extremely nice and helpful.Moreover I experienced a âVIP-serviceâ for the whole trip perfectly planned by this company and some pure luck:â¢	the flight with Scenic Air was definitely a scenic flight as Mark flew only me from         Windhoek to Wolwedansâ¢	each lodge was informed that I am a vegetarian and a photographerâ¢	during my stay at Wolwedans I had a private excellent guide giving me incredible         possibilities to photograph, beside that the girls at the camp made my stay so         comfortable that I left it heavy-heartedlyâ¢	the transfer to the early morning ballooning and back was well organizedâ¢	although a client damaged the new car I should have received, they organized         me the same car from a rental car company and Kady informed me about this in         advanceâ¢	the fact that Edward got me into busy Sossus Dune Lodge gave me the         possibility to drive into Dead Vlei for sunset, full moon and to climb up Big-Daddy         for sunriseâ¢	for the photography-tour at Kanaan Desert Retreat which was booked in advance         I have gotten the possibility to attend first the morning and evening activities with         a group to tell Kai, the manager of Kanaan the next day exactly what I would         prefer to do privately with him in this huge, beautiful area, additionally Kai offered         me my most exciting close-up photo shooting ever with the two cheetahs in the         sand dunesâ¢	I had whole Eagles Nest all by myself as I was the only guest â one morning the         wild horses just passed by my doorâ¢	in Kolmanskop my arrival was expected as you got me the special permit to get         in and out beside the opening hoursâ¢	in Intu Africa Zebra Lodge I again was the only guest and the morning walk with         the San was well organizedMany thanks to Edward for organizing this amazing & adventurous trip.

Gail M,"Lone Tree, CO",Adventure of a lifetime,"Namibia is an amazing country with SO much to see. Namibia Tours and Safaris made the whole trip VERY easy and almost perfect really. It was a bit hard to get started with the plans, as the person we started working with left the company, just as we were firming up the details. Bianca took over though, and did a good job with the transition. The only glitch was that we wanted triple rooms every night possible, and we were told it would only be possible for about a third of the nights. But when we got to the lodges, there were triples at most of them. The lodges switched us when they could, but it would have been nice to pay for the triples in the first place, as we booked mostly two doubles. Not sure what the cost difference would be. Other than that, all great. The car was in excellent shape, the travel plans were correct, the lodges (with one exception) were superb, and each day was a totally amazing adventure. Be sure not to underestimate the traveling times between places, as most roads are gravel and travel can be slow, albeit beautiful. No one rushes in Namibia anyway! Also, gas is a major added cost, so plan on that as well. We simply underestimated that based on the minimal information provided on mileage and gas prices. Those are SMALL critiques though, for a major, 19 day adventure. That everything went so well day after day is impressive. We saw a lot of people in similar vehicles from other companies, and many might be great, but Namibia Tours and Safaris was great! I would recommend them without hesitation.",25-Aug-15,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

You gain about 20c and can have a few hours in the sun. We seemed to have the place much ourselves. Loved the arch and the rock dassies. If poss then of course stay a night and enjoy the skies and the rocks at sunset/sunrise. If you head back to the coast via Henties bay then nip south for 14km to see the wreck of the zeila before heading back up to cape cross. Think the seal reserve closes at 5pm?

We were about halfway up Big Daddy when the sun rose. Luckily for us it then slipped behind broken cloud and we  enjoyed the climb often pausing to look at the view. We started the climb on the 'left' side of the dune which cut out  a lot of the initial ridge walk. Google maps has a good satellite image to look at before you plan your route. Only one woman and a guide was in front of us - they had gone by the time we reached the top and then we had the place to ourselves for about 3/4 hour to an hour when one young couple arrived. We gave them some time to enjoy the peace by taking our leave and ran down the steep side ( surprisingly the most tiring part!) into Deadvlei. We are 42/48 and have a reasonable fitness level ( 5km jogs and long dog walks sort of standard :-) ) and found the climb easier than we expected but as I mentioned I think the lack of blazing sun helped a lot. Do take lots of water in case. We were down in Deadvlei about 9.30am or bit earlier I think. I forgot to take note of how long it took to climb.

We used a guide from Kolmanskop who presented a decent, not great picture of this unusual town.History - It seems that diamonds were first discovered here in 1908 by a railroad worker. This sparked a boom and caused a new town to spring up - Kolmanskop . At its height, the city had a 200 bed hospital, an ice making plant, water processing facilities, a casino, bowling alley and many buildings. Since the mid-1920s, better diamond discoveries in northern Namibia caused Kolmanskop to decline. Today, no one lives here except the ghosts. As you walk through town, you will see the original buildings â blasted by wind and sand - with sand dunes covering many of the buildings floors.

No photos can do this place justices, it is the most peaceful and beautiful place early in the morning. Walk down the side of the dune to the deadveli to see the dead trees as the sun rises higher in the sky, now the buses and cars arrive with many people.

Food is very good and the driver/guide was excellent (Tafi). Etosha Safari Lodge: Another beautiful lodge surrounded by bush. Built on a rise with the comfortable cottages laid out on either side of the main building. But the outstanding feature is the huge deck/dining area, high above the bush with an enormous view for the African sunsets that fill the sky, and also for watching thunderclouds building up all around. A bit too big : 65 rooms. But the stunning view makes in up !Waterberg Guest Farm: We rented 3 Bush chalets and were deeply touched by the harmony of their interiors. The people were very friendly, it was a familiar atmosphere with interesting talks. Take in any case their Bush Chalets.

gemcap,UAE,Unique on earth,"If you have climbed Big Daddy, you can descend down the dune to Deadvlei. Else you can park in the parking lot and walk the distance across Deadvlei. (2 km back and forth) This is the point to where Tsauchab flowed, when in flood. As the dunes grew and cut off access to the river, the trees were deprived of water, the lime & clay pan hardened and the camel thorn trees that grew in the vlei died. Burnt black by the sun, the trees  are estimated to have been dead for about 900 years and were living for 100- 200 years before that.  The lime content in the clay give Deadvlei its distinctive white colour and cracked look. The black trees held fast in the white clay pan, against the red sand dunes below a cloudless vivid blue sky makes for perhaps the single most photographed site in the Namib Sand Sea.",27-Jan-16,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole
gemcap,UAE,A unique geological marvel in Namibia,"We added Spitzkoppe to our itinerary after seeing photos of the stunning rock formations and terrain , and are extremely happy we did so, as we would have missed out on one of Namibiaâs most unique offerings otherwise.  The rock formations are 150 million years â 750 million years. They are breathtakingly beautiful both in shape and colour, which varies from dark reddish to yellowish red and make for striking photographs. For once, the photos on an official website do not lie.RATES:   Day Visits : N$ 40 pp & N$ 50 for vehicleCamping : N$ 120 pp, Chalet : N$ 370 pp, Meals : Pay cash at the restaurantCHALETS : There are 3 chalets which are a 2 minute walk from the reception. Think basic, clean and adequate. Our Chalet had three beds with perfectly adequate linen and blankets. Couple of plug points ; there was no kettle / coffee station.  The toilet (2) and the showers (2) are separate from each other by about 15 metres. These are different from the showers and the toilets which are for the campers, though Very well maintained toilets, with a wash basin. The showers (wash basin inside) have piping hot water thanks to the solar heater outside.CAMPING : There are 30 camp sites, which in total can house upto about 200 people. The camp sites are quite far from each other, in some cases 2-3 km apart, so you are not in anyone's face. Unauthorised camping is not allowed â there are security patrols which go around the camp. There are enclosed long drop toilets neat the camp sites with showers are near the reception RESTAURANT:  Dinner has to be booked by 16.00. There is a handwritten menu on the blackboard with a pretty good variety; the food was delicious. There is a small bar. Service is good and friendly HIGHLIGHTSâ¢ The map given at the reception when you check-in, marks out the highlights of Spitzkoppe. This is also available on the internet and I had printed off a copy before we left. The link is here.http://www.campsa.co.za/sites/campsa/campsa.nsf/0/9EC4A0B65AD435B242257C8D003D0E72/$File/Map.JPG Go just beyond Camp Site 11 for an un-hindered (by rocks) view of the sunset. Be prepared for pesky flies in the cooler evenings. The best place to view the sunrise is near the Chalets or around Campsite 17 / 18.â¢ Campsites 12 / 13 are closest to the formation Boxing Glovesâ¢ The most photographed formation - Rock Bridge - can be visited on your own. For the other notable formations which are inside the Reserve and to visit the Bushmen paintings which are reckoned to be between 2000- 4000 years old, you need a guide which costs N$ 50 pp for 1 hour. Inform the reception with a few hoursâ notice, if you want to book a guide. I would highly recommend this as you will otherwise miss out on the highlights. The guide will accompany you in your car.  Paintings at Small Bushman's paradise seem to be better preserved than at Bushmanâs paradise. Avoid using the camera flash when taking photos of the paintings. You need to be in relatively good physical condition when climbing the rocks. They look easy but are not. The rock surface varies depending on their age - a few million years apart. When you walk on some, the surface can start crumbling gently e.g Daub cave while others are extremely smooth and difficult to get a grip on. e.g Rock Bridgeâ¢ A climb into / through Daub cave (not Dove Cave) gives a superb view of the reserve.â¢ If you want to climb Gross Spitzkoppe, inform the camp well in advance as the climb will take anything from 5 â 8 hours depending on your physical condition.   Wear sunglasses and a hat / sunscreen. Wear closed shoes with REALLY good grip.  Keep plenty of water in the car. It gets very hot towards the mid mornings in August. Take your binoculars with you / in the car. Horses are available if you want to go horseriding. Take a torch when you go out at night. It is pitchblack at night.

That means you charter a private plane and travel around the country. We used a company called Wings (also booked by Bianca) and had the most extraordinary pilot, Arno. We were lucky enough to have him for each of our flights, and he really made the trip just lovely!

GillieWere,"Menorca, Spain",An 18-day Namibian odyssey,"In spite of not booking until about 4 weeks before our departure, Bianca - our consultant at NTS, came up with a wonderful 18-day self-drive itinerary, and managed to book nearly all her/our first choice Lodges.  In the cases where she couldn't she found alternatives which were all (bar one) excellent and in several cases breath-taking (Fish River Canyon, Desert Homestead Outpost, Doro Narwas, Onguma Tented Camp).Our itinerary, after a couple of small tweeks, was great and enabled us to visit many of Namibia's best destinations, and see so much wildlife.  Namibia is a vast, arid beautiful country.  The long straight roads are practically empty, and although mainly gravel they are for the most part wide and in good condition.  The hard copy of our itinerary was handsomely produced with plenty of information on each destination, the lodges and activities available, and a good map.  Our only criticism would be that we would have appreciated more information on the distances we would be travelling each day, the approximate time the journey would take, and the state of some of the roads.  We may be partly to blame for not having asked more about the driving.  We expected to be driving long distances some days as Namibia is such a vast country, but we had no idea that one can go for hours without seeing another soul, car or building, let alone a shop or a coffee stop.  Punctures are an accepted part of driving in Namibia, for although the roads are by and large quite good, if you do hit a dry river bed unexpectedly, and you get a puncture in the middle of nowhere, in 45 degree heat in the middle of the day, it's not much fun.  I would suggest that perhaps for a couple in their 70's (which we are) this sort of self-drive experience is a bit reckless!   In hindsight maybe we should have opted for one of NTS alternative itineraries with a driver/guide to worry about punctures, etc. but we survived and loved our adventure!In our 18 days and 4,000 kms we took in the Kalahari, Fish River Canyon, the wild horses of Aus, Kolmanscop - an abandoned diamond mining town now overtaken by desert, the famous endless red dunes of Sossusvlei, the desert-adapted elephants of Damaraland, Etosha National Park, and so much more.I would suggest for anyone - of certain years - visiting Namibia, that a minimum of 2 nights at each lodge would be more relaxing than moving on each day, so perhaps try to see fewer places, and enjoy some relaxation in between the activities and the driving.Thank you Bianca for planning our Namibian adventure at such short notice, and for making the whole booking and payment process so easy and straightforward.  we shall certainly recommend you to other would-be Namibian adventurers!",13-Apr-17,Couples,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve

Giulia,"Pisa, Italy",Beautiful trip and flawless organisation,"NTS planned a 15 days self drive tour of Namibia for our family (we have two kids 12 and 10). We drove a 4wd from Windhoek to central kalahari, sussusvlei, swakopmund, Damaraland, kowarib, sesfontain, etosha, okonjima and back to Windhoek.The trip was beautiful and flawless organisation wise! We had lots of fun and we had experiences we will remember forever. The planning started in September 2019 for a trip already fully booked when COVID hit. NTS rebooked everything for 2021 and then again for 2022. In all this process NTS was always professional and understanding and we always felt supported no matter the difficulties every tour operator must have been through in those days. We appreciated since the planning phase the first proposal of lodges but also the willingness to understand our budget and our needs in order to find the best solution for us! So we ended up with a perfect mix from self catering accommodations to up scale lodges. We tried the experience of a tended camp, of luxury lodges and farms, we stayed inside etosha resorts for two nights and outside for 2 other nights, so we really did try lots of different accommodations style. We would go back to all of them for different reasons. The one we liked less is the one we insisted on and NTS was not really keen on booking for us!ð.The planning was done by Ulrike and finalised by Julia with a detailed itinerary with lots of info and possibilities. She also checked up on us during our trip. We also appreciated the introduction done by Carlo (informative, straight and fun) and his last minute suggestions! Namibia is a beautiful and welcoming country. Self drive in Namibia it is easy and fun, we spotted a lot of animals just self driving. Combining self driving with guided activities is a way to get the most out of your trip (including things you cannot do alone) without loosing the sense of indipendence and adventure that the self drive gives you. All activities booked through NTS were top notch and carried out by highly skilled and reputable guides and operators. At the same time whenever requested NTS accommodated our own requests, either by letting us book them ourselves or by incorporating it into their planning. They really are flexible. Both during the planning phase and during the trip the communication was fast and effective, we always felt the sense of safety and security we want from your local tour operator.

For the next 9 days Oke quickly became one of our trip and understood us extremely well.  We didn't have to think about anything, our trip down to the last detail was planned for us and everything went to plan.  We were booked in some super guest houses and lodges throughout the 9 days, all were comfortable and the food was excellent.  We then left Oke with some sadness for our trip to Victoria Falls, once again the lodge Wilmari chose for us exceeding our expectations and was a fantastic end to a memorable holiday.Stand out moments for us, were the Namibia desert at 6 in the morning, colours are fantastic, seeing desert elephants in Damarland and game spotting in Estosha.

There were lots of items including animal figurines, fabric goods, leather goods, jewelry, tea, etc. There was huge diversity in the size of goods available and range of prices (though they were reasonable). Prices are set, so there is no bargaining.

Be careful if you drive into dune 40 as there is deep sand and we almost got stuck.We were driving from there to Swakopmund and that road is the worst highway we've met in Namibia. It doesn't require a 4 x4 but is extremely rutted and corrugated and is not fun.

Graham S,"Hove, UK",Namibia and Okavango Delta 'African Adventure',"My wife and I have just returned from a Namibian Tours and Safaris (NTS) 15 Day Ultimate Namibia and Okavango Delta Fly-in Safari. The Namibian scenery was breathtaking and the game viewing amazing. The Lodges/Camps were varied but all had their different character and charm. But perhaps the ultimate highlight was the people. Everywhere we stayed the Guides and Staff were a delight - professional, friendly and knowledgeable.If we had to choose our favourite accommodation, Wolwedans Mountain View Suite and Little Ongava would top the list of Lodges but Shipwreck Lodge was amazing too and gets a mention for being so totally different. Of the Camps, Hoanib Valley Camp would get our vote. But for game viewing, whilst Namibia was amazing, the Okavango Delta was simply stunning.A word too for the Air Charter Companies. Scenic Air, Wings Over Africa and Mack Air were all first class. Every flight ran to schedule, the liaison with the Lodges/Camps was faultless (not once were we left wondering about the arrangements) and the pilots professional and friendly. A particular mention for Mack Air who provided a member of staff to guide us through Maun Airport from the minute we touched down from Namibia until we were safely on board our flight to Shinde airstrip. And a representative of Safari Destinations (the Botswana partner company of NTS) was also on hand to check that all was well. The service we experienced was hard to beat.But our biggest word of appreciation goes to the team at Namibian Tours and Safaris for putting everything together. We were delighted with the itinerary, Lodges and Camps they recommended and from our initial contact in November 2018, to the conclusion of our trip, they were 'with us all the wayâ. Every e-mail and question was answered promptly, nothing was too much trouble and as time went by it became obvious just how many NTS colleagues were involved behind the scenes. We would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Namibian Tours and Safaris.",21-Oct-19,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

As we were a large group of twelve, it worked out to be too expensive. When I told them this, they quickly sent me other options and alternate ways of doing the trip. We ended up with a single van instead of landrover 4X4's and skipped the lunch to do our own. They were very flexible on the adapting of the trip to suit us. We were met at the port by Augustinius who showed us around. We stopped at the dune 7 and were given time to climb the dune, we went to the ""moonlandscape"" as well as the reserve area to look at the plants etc. We went to the local wimpy in Swakopmund for lunch and were also able to stop at the beachfront to look around at the shells and have a walk on the beach. All in all, I think we did pretty much everything that there was time to do. Augustinius was a fantastic guide and his knowledge of the plants, animals and especially the geology of the area was outstnding.

This was exactly what I wanted to experience.  I followed our guide, Winton, on an exhilarating yet safe adventure up and down the dunes.  The trip also included a light lunch.  Others in the tour that did not want to drive it themselves were able to ride with the guide at a reduced price.  Winton gave us a radio to stay in touch with him the entire time, providing safety instructions, while he also pointed out points of interest along the way.  In my opinion, the ""self-drive"" is the way to go and this company was one of the few that offered the opportunity to do it at a reasonable cost.  Look no further.  This is the company to go with.  Thank you, Winton, for an amazing experience.",2-Aug-24,Couples,Otjikoto Lake

Hadar B,"Malkiya, Israel",10 day Guided Tour in Namibia,"We had a 10 day tour in Namibia with Wild Wind Safaris. Tour was tailor-made for us, by Martha, in the most professional attitude and affable service. Martha thought and took care of every detail planning our trip, from airport transportation, special dietary needs, through answering questions, and above all making our dreams & wishes come true. All arrangements were done in a very short time just 3 weeks prior to our arrival.10 days are hardly enough for a whole experience of Namibia, yet our tight well planned itinerary made it possible for us to receive so much in such a short period. Our tour was amazing !! We would like to express special appreciation and thanks to our guide Jonathan. Thanks to Jonathan who knows 'everyting about anything' and has a true 'guide spirit' we experienced Namibia in a most interesting, educating and fun way.

There are number of beautiful short hikes to be made, but these can be very hot in summer. The guard at the entrance gate were very friendly to us. Also we got stuck in the sand. The trick is to reduce the tire pressure to 1.7 barr or even 1.5. You will be amazed how that makes the difference. We had our tires put back on the right pressure at the petrol station near the entrance of the park for a tip a 20 rand.",25-Mar-20,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

haheeren,"Lincoln City, OR",Fabulous 2 week holiday,"We had a fabulous holiday staying in 5 different lodges and flying in a private charter to get from location to location.  I was glad we did not drive because we were able to stay more places.  Our first stop was Onguma Tented Camp which we loved.  The service, room, food and excursions were all without fault.  Our 2nd location was Okahirongo Elephant Camp.  This location was our least favourite.  Overall it was just a notch below the rest of the lodges we stayed at, and didn't offer anything unique to anywhere else we stayed.  Also the excursion to the Himba Village we felt was a hoax.  The story on arrival (after you've bumped in the vehicle an hour to get there) is that the rest of the village is at a funeral far away for the day and only two older women have been left behind.  Oh and the cattle are at better grazing on the other side of the mountain.  The camp is clearly abandoned and no one has been living there for a long time.  Why not be upfront about it and say this was where they used to be, but no one lives here now.  It made us angry when we realized we were being lied to.  Our 3rd stay in Damaraland was at Doro Nawas.  We enjoyed it a lot, the staff are friendly, the bush dinner was fun and we had an excellent game drive finding a herd of elephants and watching them for about 1 1/2 hours.  Our 4th location was Hoodia Desert Lodge.  I would rate this as the best place we stayed, or a tie with Onguma.  The scenery, room and food were fabulous.  What they did the best of anyone was their excursions though.  The day with our guide Johnny in a comfortable vehicle to Sossusvlei was the highlight of our trip.  He showed and taught us so much.  He gave us great advice so we were able to climb Big Daddy, and then the lunch that was laid out for us by him was lovely and delicious.  He left to go pay the park fees while we dined alone and just enjoyed the peace and quiet and good food.  Our last stay was at Wolwedans Tented Camp and it was a great way to end our holiday.  I can't imagine a more beautiful sunset and scenery combination as what we experienced there.  I can totally recommend NTS to plan your dream Namibian Holiday as they did ours.",24-Apr-17,Couples,Desert Explores

Those who don't fancy the climb to the top can take a walk around Dead Vlei at the bottom of the dune, which is a great opportunity to practice your photography skills.Try to go on a day that isn't too windy, and go as early as you can to avoid all the tour groups and heat of the sun. Make sure you bring as much water as you can carry - I drank 4 litres between starting off and getting back to the car. Another tip is to make sure you bring suitable footwear - it's great to climb the dune barefoot but by the time you make it down the sand is so hot it's impossible to walk on, so make sure you bring some shoes.",8-May-17,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

They even go as far as breeding Anatolian Shepherds with the sole purpose of giving them to farmers to help protect their livestock from potential predators - including cheetahs.You won't want to miss this if you're in the area - and it's a long drive down a dead end road - but well worth it.",10-Feb-14,Couples,Namutoni

Yes, there will probably be plenty of other people there, but it is a beautifully other-worldly sight to see. Don't forget your camera! We only spent one night at the park's camp and had a brief time in the afternoon upon arrival to settle in and attempt to summit a dune for sunset (we didn't quite make it- and I'm not certain it ever ended!) Then an early wake-up to pack up and hit Dune 45 on the way to Deadvlei. We made a few photo stops on the way...one at which I dropped my camera on the side of the road- to my dismay when I discovered it missing miles down the road. We went back and looked for more time than we had- to no avail. On a long desert road with few distinguishing features, there was no figuring out where we had stopped earlier. The miraculous part is someone found it (a guide named John Mernert) and turned it in to the incredible Selma Lucas at the park office/shop. I had optimistically left her my number in case it was turned in, and resigned myself to the fact that I had lost all those photos from my trip. I place more value on photos and photography than I should when traveling, so I chalked it up to a hard lesson learned. But lo and behold, the next day I received a phone call from Selma telling me that my camera had been found. Once you're there, you will realize how incredible this is that someone could possibly find it. We then arranged for her to send it to Windhoek for me to pick up before I left. I regret to say I was a little dubious, since I had offered a reward for its return. I regret even more that I haven't yet delivered on that promise- but I still plan to somehow, and very belatedly. Because sure enough, my very own camera was waiting for me, complete with all my photos. If you stop in the park office/shop and you see Selma Lucas, maybe help me out and give her a small token of gratitude for being such a great person! She really went above and beyond- just like everything there in Namib-Naukluft National Park. I'm convinced that place is just magic all-around. My only other regret is that we didn't have more time there. A day and a half (although we had even less than that) definitely isn't enough to fully enjoy all it has to offer. But this is a must-see place, don't miss it even if you don't have enough time to make the most of it. It's well worth every moment!",27-Dec-15,Friends,Namib Desert

He went out of his way to make our trip as pleasant as possible. It felt like we were driven around by a member of the family. Everything was made easy. Ronnie accompanied us climbing ""Big Daddy"", a huge dune in Sossusvlei and out-climbed the 3 of us. What a wonderful day that was. Next morning we did the 1 hour helicopter ride (it was too hot for the balloon). No matter the price it's worth it. At first we were a bit apprehensive in doing this tour given that it was the ""rainy season"". Well there was no need, except maybe Etosha, but even here Ronnie was able to find the wildlife. Accommodations were superb, especially the Desert Home Stead Lodge and Camp Kipwe. Their settings were absolutely stunning. When in Swakopmund we recommend taking a tour to Sandwich Bay. We used Turnstone Tour and were happy we did. The tour included a picnic near the beach and a wonderful crazy ride through the dunes. What a thrill!!!!!Ronnie is a through ambassador for Namibia.

We cannot comment on the day visit facilities but the full board with driver and chef at Babson House was perfect.  If you stay at Babson for at least a couple of days, you get all of the regular tours of the facilities plus much closer contact with the cheetahs.  The four ""Ambassador Cheetahs"" live in an enclosure just beyond the balcony of the house and can be seen any time you feel inclined, which is often.  The scientific conservation work done here is also exemplary.  There were excellent game drives on offer to see a wide range of antelope, birds etc. with no other safari vehicles in sight.

Hong Kong,"Hong Kong, China",Hats off to CCF!,"We just visited the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) near Otjiwarongo and had a very good experience that is well worth recommending to fellow travellers and a repeat visit in the future. The CCF is located along R2440, 43 kilometres east of the B1, just north of Otjiwarongo. The facilities are modern and include a small museum, gift shop, cafe as well as a large fenced in areas where the cheetahs live and are cared for. First and foremost the CCF is a research and conservation centre with the mission of saving the cheetahs in the wild. However, there are tourist related activities that allow visitors close access and a chance to observe these fascinating creatures in a variety of activities. You can find information about all cheetah related activities directly on the CCF website. You can book all activities directly online or through your travel agent. During our visit, we participated in the Cheetah Run and the cheetah drive. The Cheetah Run is a 40-45 minute experience where you stay in a gated standing area within an enclosure where cheetahs exercise each morning (8am) by chasing a cloth rag attached to a rope which is controlled by a motorised system. It is amazing watching the cheetahs stalk the cloth and give chase. Their acceleration is remarkable and they are just beautiful creatures when running in full stride. We also participated in the Cheetah Drive that lasted just over an hour. Here we drove in an enclosure which had 6 older female cheetahs. The vehicle was a typical safari jeep with three rows of seats. It was lovely driving around spotting the cheetahs, which were all very comfortable with the vehicle. This allowed close access and many opportunities for close up photos. Ignatius the ranger/driver shared much information about the cheetahs and also positioned the jeep correctly with the nice morning sunlight which helped with our photo taking. After the two cheetah experiences, we were shown the goat farm and the Anatolian Shepherd dogs which are being raised at CCF. We learned how CCF is working with local farmers to improve their herding practices (much to do with the use of the Anatolian Shepherds) to help reduce interactions with cheetahs, a major cause for the killing of these lovely creatures over the years in Namibia. In the end, we were very pleased with our two cheetah experiences and felt the CCF were doing a very good job and acting highly responsible in everything they were doing. This seems to be the real deal and not a commercialisation arrangement whereby the cheetahs are being exploited or living in bad conditions. From what we could tell, the CCF truly care about the cheetahs, their survival and ability to thrive in Namibia. In this regard, they gained our full approval and support and are a place we would very much like to return to in the future.",24-Sep-16,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

One of the most fascinating things about them is that, although they are many miles inland, they include carvings of seals and penguins, demonstrating that those people travelled to the coast.The carvings are carefully protected and you are obliged to take a tour.  Our guide, Philomena, was knowledgeable and welcoming (and very glamorous - the ""safari kit with Chanel earrings"" look rocks, if you'll pardon the pun!).  She shared lots of interesting background detail, and also patiently answered my questions about the fascinating Damara language, which the guides speak between themselves.

Hubert S,"Paris, France",A 19 day solo self-drive through Namibia which was perfect in every way!,"I was planning a solo self-drive safari in Namibia with a local operator, and to my surprise only very few operators seem to cater for solo travelers. This is how I ended up with Namibia Tours and Safaris, whoâs website immediately created confidence to me.It already started off perfectly with a pleasant contact with one of their their tour consultants Tessa. She perfectly understood my requirements, and together we customized an epic and magnificent self-drive tour through Namibia. I was looking for safari in Etosha, mountains, possibilities to hike, plenty of wildlife, and plenty of splendid scenery to photograph. Since I was doing this solo I decided to skip camping because the logistics would be too time consuming to do alone. Instead I requested for mid-range lodging with the occasional luxury splurge. I also would be interested in some of the less frequently visited sites. And they delivered...Upon arrival I was welcomed at the airport and accompanied to my first stay in Windhoek where the car was handed over to me, and where we talked through the itinerary and itâs possibilities. It was an informal and very warm welcome. The car was a comfortable sturdy and no-frills 4x4 pickup with two spare tires, and satellite navigation. Their approach to road safety and personal safety is serious yet simple. Just a few simple rules and  some common sense and off I was to a worry free experience. The case had GPS tracking on board and they would search you out in case they can see you are stuck somewhere out there for multiple. A nice safety feature when alone. They also include a mobile phone and a GPS phone can be rented optionally.Then the trip itself started. I went all round the country and visited famous and lesser known sites. I hiked, I photographed, I saw lost of wildlife, and and I slept in splendid lodges. I met interesting fellow travelers, but sometimes also drove for hours without seeing a single other car! Everything was perfectly arranged, and all of the lodges I stayed were very good to excellent. Some of them even outright brilliant. 19 days later when I returned the car in Windhoek I looked back on a wonderful epic trip, and it felt as if I had been travelling around Namibia for months. Iâve attached a few photos (I can attach no more than 10) to give a limited and far from exhaustive cross section of things Iâve seen. Also, I am working on reviews of the places where I stayed and the sites Iâve visited with more photoâs, so you could follow me for more reviews related to this trip.Donât look further and book your Namibia self-drive safari with them.

But its worth it for the mega slide down from the top - a unique experience!

I_over_P,"Munich, Germany",Hard work but soooo worth it!!!! And so much fun to run downhill...,"We started early and entered the park when the gates opened. If you donât have a proper 4x4 car, take the shuttle bus from the car park instead, because the last km of road are really sandy and in a bad condition. It costs 170 NR per person, kids pay half. The climb is harder than it looks and it gets very hot around 10.30am. You cannot really go at your own speed because the path is very narrow and there are people in front and behind you and you donât want to hold up everyone. If you are used to hiking, it is absolutely doable, but donât underestimate the intense heat and sun exposure.The views when you reach the top are absolutely stunning. The best bit is when you walk down the steep side of the dune towards Deadvlei. It looks so steep, but you sink into the sand really deep which slows down the descend. Then walking back to the shuttle bus via Deadvlei is a beautiful and great way to end your morning hike.",3-Sep-18,Family,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve
Î¤ÏÎ±Î²ÎµÎ»ÎµÎÏÎ¿Ï,"London, UK",It is what it says on the tin!,I 've been to a few spooky places around the world but Kolmanskop has to be the most eerie of them all. The guided tour was very good and all the guides were trained to a high standard. Polite yet funny and knowledgeable. Facilities were adequate for the venue. A little shop for souvenirs and snacks is located in the main Hall. On the downside I found that its a shame that De Beers doesn't spend a bit of money in restoring some of the buildings that are reclaimed by the sand dunes as it seems that in a few years a lot of them will be buried or damaged beyond repair. Luderitz is not the most accessible place on the planet and visitors should be rewarded accordingly I think. Nevertheless a fantastic place to visit which demonstrates best how the human kind can thrive in a hostile environment such as that for so long and with very little means. I hope I can take my sons out there one day as well.,31-Oct-14,Solo,Okaukuejo waterhole

Ian M,"Glasgow, UK",A ghost town-but very different from what you might expect to find!,"If you are in the coastal town of Luderitz, I'd encourage you to take a trip out to see this ghost town-it was built for miners and their families at the end of the 19th century. Some of the buildings are half-covered in sand, but some have been restored-you can see a typical house with all its contents from the period and a bowling alley used by the miners for recreation. The range of facilities that the miners had is very impressive-not like a ""Wild West"" ghost town at all. There's a good shop, cafÃ© and exhibition on diamond smuggling, so a lot to see. Guides will walk you round the town and give you lots of information as well as the chance to explore independently, so will suit many tastesMake sure however you wear long trousers as it gets very windy, and the driving sand can sting bare legs.

Indigo123,"Perth, Australia",So interesting that it's exhausting!,"Wow! This was amazing. Interesting both for the fun of exploring and the options for photography.Get the amateur photographer's permit that allows entrance from sunrise to sunset, even if you're not interested in photography - we got there just after 6.00am and had the place entirely to ourselves for three hours. We spent six hours there in total, including a tour and brunch.Wear thick-soled enclosed shoes because there are rocks, broken glass and rusty nails on the ground. I saw some visitors in thongs (flip-flops) which would have restricted the amount of exploring they could do (I wore hiking boots). You have to be on the lookout everywhere for dodgy floorboards, broken cement and nails sticking out of things, so it's probably not a good place to visit with small kids. For example, it looks possible to fall through the floor/ceiling on the upper floors of some of the buildings. I went into every building and it was pretty tiring climbing up and down over piles of sand, so I'm glad I'd rested the day before. My Fitbit recorded 75 flights of stairs! Luckily we weren't there on a windy day, because battling that too would have been more exhausting.The cakes and scones at the cafe were DELICIOUS.

Some of the old houses have been restored to give the visitor a better idea of what it was like so many years ago and some of the houses have been left partly ruin which gives a more realistic feeling to the old time town.

Inesanto,"San Diego, CA",Strenuous but worth it,"Climbing Big Daddy was challenging, no doubt. If itâs something youâre planning on doing take the following tips into consideration. 1) Go very early! Ideally around 6 or 7 am. The sun gets very strong. 2) Bring a liter of water with you. I carried a 16 oz bottle of water and regretted it half way through. 3) Sunscreen, of course. 4) Light clothes and light shoes (Teva sandals with thin socks isnât a great look but believe me, climbing the biggest sand dune in the world with heavy trekking boots will make it even more difficult). 5) If youâre not in good physical health, especially if you have heart or respiratory conditions. It might not be a good idea for you to climb. Again, itâs not an easy climb; going up and down takes about 2 hours, depending on your pace. With that being said, once you reach the top the view is simply breathtaking and unreal. Going down is much much easier, faster and so much fun.",5-Jun-19,Family,Waterberg National Park

If you don't want to go into all that troubble you can go on foot (not very reccommendable since even 5km can be a fare distance when walking in deep sand) or get on board one of the shuttle buses (costs very little).We drove there ourselves and it was quite an experience....We saw many beetles (Tok Tokies) and lizzards.,13-Aug-13,Family,Namib-Naukluft National Park

The guided tour is well organised and very informative. In summer it gets really hot so better to be there in the morning or in the afternoon, in winter any part of the day is bearable.

Isaac William Wells,"Rockwall, TX",A point never to be missed.,"When reading about ghost towns, this place sumirse it all. Climbing up and down the stairs of every house, of every building, which are almost totally submerged in desert sand, buried in time, and disfigured by the forces of nature, one feels embraced and taken by the sound of the wind and by the sunlight both penetrating through every crack of every door, window or walls, when suddenly a sensation of nostalgia hits. Then, one begins to wonder about those days and lives that populated such barren but very much alive forgotten place. It was a paradise for me since I love photography; I remember feeling, at every turn, as if I was being pushed forward; I had this inner telling me to go far, get in, go deeper inside, further, further and get lost regardless of my travel companion awaiting. This voice kept pushing me towards every corner, every nook to be rewarded in the end with such incredible views, contrasts, and games shadows and  lights. One must be careful at times though of the frailty of the structures, and of protruding pointy parts that can cause injury if one gets too excited about. At one point we felt we could create our own mystery or suspenseful story and document it on a sort of blair witch project so to speak. At the end of the visit there is a chance to sit in the coffee shop and take it all in while being served a cool drink to freshen up. Excellent guided tours are also offered. Take it all in from the outside first, then explore as you wish the Bavarian architecture within the Namib Desert. Spare at least three hours to make a proper visit, or have the photographic permit dealt with so that you can stay lingering through during the whole day, so that the detour to this place is worth it.",20-May-19,Couples,Spitzkoppe

Logically the dry one, since animals concentrate where there is water available, otherwise they will scatter around throughout the huge park surfaces. Dry season runs usually from April to September( the problem today and during this year is that climate became unpredictable and seasons do not follow anymore the same patterns. Etosha has been facing a very significant drought because there was no rainy season this year, and even waterholes dry faster; consequently, wildlife flee far away or die of thirst. Recently, according to a scientific report published already online, Namibia is facing a wildlife crisis and the estimate of wildlife casualties expected this year will reach April. 50.000 dead animals only due to the lack of water.

Scheduling for transfers between lodges and airport was not provided in advance to us and some duplicate arrangements were made as a result. The suggested game drive and boat cruise were beyond expectation with great local historical and wildlife information from the guides. Much Appreciated. Victoria Falls as a tourist attraction town failed considerably.,25-Nov-15,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

She was very reactive, proposing an itinerary and lodges which fit our wishes and making valuable suggestions. She was very kind at all times, answering to all our questions and remarks. Everything was clear, detailed and precise.We were very satisfied with our guide Philip. We felt very secure and peacefull with him. Philip is a very nice person, feels like a friend. He has a good sense of humour, cool and relax. Philip was at all times willing to satisfy our needs and was a great guide, knowing every place of interest and all interesting spots for wildlife viewing. We also had very valuable discussions with him about Namibia culture and way of life. We enjoyed Kalahari, Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, Sandwich Harbour, Walvis bay lagoon cruise, Cape Cross seal colony, Damaraland, a cheetah farm. We also spent 3 days at Etosha where we were able to see a fantastic and very diversified wildlife. I definitively recommend WWS for a Namibian adventure.

James Black,"Eastbourne, UK",Professionally facilitated glimpse into the ancient past,"This really is a ""must do"" on any Namibia trip in this fascinating part of the country. Nestling in the far corner of a valley that once housed wildlife in droves, is the remains of an early pioneering family's homestead. Here they discovered the remains of ancient cave art, exposed by various rock slides. Short tours on foot are led by local experts trained to relay the finer details of this easily accessible yet  important part of Namibia's ancient culture. The whole experience has an authenticity to it as a result. There is a charming welcome centre on site built from recycled material, the whole site runs on sustainable energy and refreshments and curios are also available. Highly recommended and well worth the drive.",19-Sep-16,Couples,Namutoni
James Bond,"London, UK",Prehistoric artists,"Background: Twyfelfontein is an ""open-air rock gallery"" with the largest single concentration of pteroglyphs (rock engravings) in southern Africa.  A UNESCO World Heritage Site, there are over 2,000 rock engravings and a few rock paintings in the area, probably made over a period of 2,000 years by local San hunter-gatherer peoples, representing an important aspect of their ritual and belief systems. More than 200 giraffe and 100 rhinos are shown as well as ostrich, impala, elephant and zebra.  Predators like lions or cheetas are scarce, although one particular lion is exceptional.  Kudu (antelope), wildebeest and baboons are also rare in the engravings.  Although human figures are common in the rock paintings, they rarely occur in the engravings as well. Four trails (Dancing Kudu, Lion Man, etc) offer visitors the best and most prominent of these rock engravings. PROS: The site is small enough and the engravings are concentrated enough to be covered in an hour or so. The pteroglyphs are all well-preserved, thanks to a mandatory guided-tour-only policy as well as well-placed, specially-constructed metal viewing platforms at certain points on the trail. There is a Visitor Information Centre, from where you can arrange these escorted tours.  CONS: Located north of Swakopmund and west of Otjimarongo, it is a bit remote and out of the way -- like Fish River Canyon and many other Namibian attractions -- unless you billet either at the Abu Huab community camp (where our group had done) or the Spitzkoppe Camp. Overland tour groups (like us) pass by here about once a week and so it may feel touristy to some people if they happened to visit the site at the same time. Some rock engravings are either so fragile or difficult to reach, and are thus not accessible to visitors.Verdict: If pteroglyphs are your ""cup of tea"", it is well worth the visit, albeit remote. Contrary to some reviews, it is far from touristy (not like Disneyland or London!). But, if you are already in Namibia, you should include this in your list of attractions to see. Recommended. Grade A-minus..",31-Aug-13,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole
James Bond,"London, UK",The Dead Zone,"Background: Less famous than Sossusvlei but, nonetheless more interesting, Deadvlei (from English ""dead"" + Afrikaans ""vlei"" for marsh) is a dried-up white clay pan located inside the Namib-Naukluft Park in southern Namibia. Enclosing this area, it is claimed, are one of the highest sand dunes in the world. For bit of scale, the dune ""Big Daddy"" is as high as the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building in NY. Inside the pan, the area is dotted here and there by dead Acacia trees (some 900 years old). It is so dry here that these dead trees did not decompose, but was rather scorched in place by the searing sun, blackening the wood for all time.PROS: Deadvlei is only 5 km from Sossusvlei so that you may combine both in one half-day trip. I believe there is shuttle service to and from the parking lot. Looking much like a nuclear ground-zero, the lonely landscape holds a timeless appeal. But it is not just death and desolation here. On the contrary, there is quite a bit of life: a desert beetle, a small bush, lizard, snake, even the odd clutch of owls hanging out on a live tree at the edge of the pan.CONS: The soft loose sand lining the last 5 km ""road"" heading to the parking lot is very difficult to drive. You'll need a 4x4 jeep. During our visit, at least one vehicle got stuck in the sand, spinning its wheels. Daytime temperatures can easily reach the high 40's Celsius. The short hike entering the pan is nothing compared to climbing the dune Big Daddy.Verdict: IMO, the lonely haunting landscape of Deadvlei presents a more interesting composition than Sossusvlei. The blackened Acacia trees stood like timeless statues against this dry and unforgiving landscape. It will definitely leave a lasting impression. A must see. Recommended.

Jan,"Oss, The Netherlands","Must see, hike is doable for kids too","We camped at sesriem Oshana and did a self drive to this dune (approx 1 h) once the gates opened (approx 6:00 am).

However, if you feel comfortable to drive the last part in deep sand yourself just kindly refuse as we did and proceed (a 4x4 is required, but itâs quite easy to do - just keep accelerating) through to gate.At arrival the sun was still behind the other dunes and therefore the hike was not too hot yet. Nevertheless bring enough water. The hike is a little tough, but we managed to make it to the highest top with 2 young kids (age 6&9). Just take your time and breaks.

I was picked up at the airport and driven to the Olive Grove Guesthouse which was superb! Wayne, the car delivery man from Namibia Tours, was really helpful, describing everything about the 4x4 vehicle. Car was in beautiful shape and free of problems for the entire trip. (by the way, the roads were very good, but you can expect to drive on gravel for most of the trip. Even with that, the gravel was ok) Carlo Basson of Namibia Tours visited me at the Olive Grove and gave me all the itinerary and vouchers and more information. The next day drove alone to Swakopmund, Stayed at the Swakopmund Hotel, went skydiving, desert tour, airplane tour. All very good. After three days drove to Sossusvlei and had to stay in three lodges because Ulrike was unable to get me into one for the four nights that I was there. Just VERY popular location, but it was ok because I got to experience three great lodges in the outback. Hiked to Deadvlei in the Sesriem, did not even attempt to climb 45 or Big Daddy dunes. Way hard! God tons of beautiful photographs of the Deadvlei. The balloon ride in the Sesariem was one of the high points of the trip. Just beautiful at sunrise!

Some are more than 5million years old.Try to go first thing in the morning or just before sunset to see the dunes in their best light. Make sure you take plenty of water and the correct footwear. You can climb some of the dunes as long as you don't mind heights (Dune 45 is the most popular one to climb).

Jay H,"Napier, South Africa",Well-informed friendliness,"All my previous tours (with many different companies, to many parts of the world) were chosen by selecting from a catalogue of pre-arranged routes. This time I wanted to arrange my own tour and I found exactly the right company to do it. I told Namibia Tours & Safaris that I wanted a solo tour and I indicated the kind of places I wished to visit. This started a correspondence with Bianca which was informative, helpful, positive. She made suggestions, provided internet links, indicated costs. Gradually, the best route with the most suitable lodges and hotels was decided - though it needed up-dating when circumstances changed. I was allocated Augustinus as my driver/guide, who arrived with an impressive final print-out of the journey we were about to take together. With Augie in the driving seat, all problems vanished in advance. While he stopped to show and explain, he also phoned ahead to ensure that all was as it should be. Together, we explored the tip of the red Kalahari, deep into the Namib, through many dramatic passes, ending with some seaside pleasure in Walvis Bay and Swakopmund. ""Attention to detail"" was the key of the initial planning and the accompanying of the traveller. Easily, I caught his own infectious enjoyment in showing off the people and places and the flora and fauna of Namibia. What a pleasure! With excellent eating and discussions along the way. (My only slight criticism is that some of the place descriptions sent to me were a bit too effusive and did not indicate any possible drawbacks. Perhaps their computer records need revisiting.) Otherwise I give this company full marks and deep gratitude for providing an aging gentleman with a most delightful and comfortable adventure.",9-May-17,Solo,Epupa Falls
Jay N,"Eugene, OR",This can be heaven or this can be hell!,"Just returned from 6 weeks in Namibia. We have travelled for 4 decades, never gone back to a place twice, but for the first time in my life can honestly say I would go back to Namibia in a heartbeat. There is so much more than Sossusvlei, but I digress. For your own benefit, I implore you to think very carefully about how you approach your time at Sossusvlei and Deadvlei in particular. There is not one correct answer- it is all about what this experience means to you. What do I mean? If you dream of making your own version of the iconic sunrise photos and/or enjoying an almost religious experience you must take ONE course of action. If you are ok trekking out and walking around with many others then you have many more choices of accommodation, timing, and transportation. If, as I overheard one man inquire of his wife, ""OK Marge, now that we are here what's next?"" you can stop reading here....So for the hardcore: You have to stay in the park. Lodge or camp sites. Limited accommodations, book way in advance. We stayed at Sossus Dune Lodge and were on the road at 5 am each day. They will pack a to-go meal. That got us to Deadvlei by 6:10 and had the place to ourselves for 30-45 minutes. That is when I truly appreciated not only is the photography special but the experience of being in this remote, ancient, absolutely silent place is magical. When was the last time you could hear your heartbeat and nothing else in such a stunning setting? By 7 am other photographers show up but with the Vlei's amazing acoustics, one hears everyone's conversations. Solitude no more... And these photographers are equally passionate but unable to stay in the park due to those limited accommodations or other issues so could not arrive early. They find themselves with lots of other passionate photographers racing to find the right compositions, struggling to make photos without people in them and occasionally expressing their frustrations openly. I'm not being critical. I am just warning you if your photography is that important, and it is to me so I get it, then you must stay in the park and you must get there early! By 8 am the tour buses arrive, lots of them, and a steady stream of people descend upon and transform the place. It's time to pack the bags and go home. Bonus of staying the park, you can repeat this adventure for sunset. Different light, angles, and almost no one else out there. Recommended but not required: your 4x4 vehicle to allow you to drive the last 6ish kilometers in sand to get to Deadvlei parking lot. Park provides shuttle starts at 6 am- if it leaves promptly, 10 minute drive, 15-30 hike through sand to get to destination, you've missed the best light. And, when it is time to leave you must queue and wait for return vehicle.We waited 30 minutes as too many people jostled for too few seats. Key- deflate tire pressure from 2 bar standard to less, people recommended anywhere from 1.2 to 1.8. I had no pressure gauge. Just deflated tires until they had plenty of surface contact. Put vehicle into low gear and most importantly, didn't stop! We made it, and in the two days we did this we saw no one stuck in sand and probably 50 vehicles at Deadvlei parking lot each day. Happy planning!!!",10-Dec-18,Couples,Dune 45
Jay N,"Eugene, OR",must see,Go early! Get photo permit (well worth the price difference) and get there pre sunrise you will have the place to yourself.

jbontherocks,"Toronto, Canada",Fabulous! Exciting! NTS is number one!!,"What a fabulous trip.  I completed a 45 day self-drive solo safari from Cape Town to Harare.  Because of Covid and other issues the planning which started in 2018 was delayed in implementation until 2022.  Through it all, every staff member I came in contact with always gave 100% to see that all my requirements were met.  Over the 2-1/2 years of planning, there were many changes in the itinerary with the last one coming just days before my departure.In the event everything flowed smoothly and the only disappointment was that I didn't see a leopard.  Everything else was a checklist item.As with any trip of this length and complexity, something was bound to not live up to expectations.  But those were minor and soon forgotten.In particular I want to commend Julia in Swakopmund and Carlo the fleet manager in Cape Town. Also a word of thanks to Tessa who started the whole process all that long time ago.I have already recommended NTS to a couple of people and would do so again at any time.The Travel Keys App was a winner.  It was an excellent day-to-day guide as to routes and times and listed activities at the various lodges.I only have one caution and that is to avoid NWR lodges.  I was booked in to Namutoni Resort at the eastern end of Etosha.  The room was okay but the dining facilities were less than desirable.  Everyone wanted to be outside for dinner and breakfast but all the tables were set inside.  You could not charge meals and drinks to your room but had to pay separately.  There was a $N30 for internet (on a room that had a rate of $N1900.  Avoid NWR resorts.I can't praise NTS too highly.",1-Jan-23,Family,Desert Explores

After the sun rise we drove all the way to Sossusvlei. Please note that you cannot drive the last 5 miles of the park unless you take a tour. You will have to take a shuttle. Our guide made us climb the tail of the dunes overlooking the Deadvlei. The view of deadvlei from the top of the and dunes look so unreal. It almost looks like a painting. After taking several pictures and soaking in the views, we ran down the sand dunes to deadvlei. That whole experience was fantastic. It took us abotu 45 m ins to climb the dunes and we ran down in less than a minute. Deadvlei is like no other place on earth. The trees are dead for over 900 years and they are still standing.

This was our first visit to Africa so we were slightly apprehensive about doing a self drive tour but everything was well organised. The lodges were very good and the food always wonderful. The gravel roads are generally very good, the only exception is the C27 which was a nightmare. It really needs regrading, but you just have to drive to the conditions.

There are several approaches of varying length and steepness so plan a bit ahead to determine what you're up for.  The sand gets in everything so unless you wear proper sand gaiters any shoe will fill up.  I wore a low top shoe with socks and was comfortable but did have to empty sand twice to be comfortable.  Bring plenty of water and drink regularly.  The views at the top are spectacular!  Panoramas and wide angle lenses are a must.

It is a quaint old town with coffee shops,restaurants and a harbour.  The highlight of our stay was our trip to Kolmanskop Ghost Town.  We went on the 9.30 am tour which lasted Â±2hrs.  Our guide was a very knowledgeable young lady who made the tour interesting. When the tour was over, we decided to have another look around.  There were houses, a bakery, a hospital, in fact a whole village, which buildings are now all derelict and the insides of the buildings were almost full of the desert sand.  Plenty of sand piled up outside the walls too.  We could enter the premises but had to tread very carefully!  The tools and equipment for all the buildings came from Germany.  They even built a railway line which was finished in about 8 months.   At the moment the line is being upgraded but not yet finished, after 10 years!   On our drive to the Ghost Town we saw a big group of wild horses close to Seeheim. These horses were apparently abandoned by the German Military during the First World War. They have adapted under the harsh semi-desert conditions and look in good condition.  I was apprehensive at going on the tour at first but am so glad I did, as we were taken back to the ""good old days"" and could understand what life was like for those German Colonists.

Wilmari was amazing - she helped make sure I saw the parts of Namibia that I most wanted to see and made sure everything about the journey was seamless.  She was very responsive when we emailed before the trip, made sure everything went smoothly, and even met up with me in Swakopmund to check in and help with some spontaneous arrangements. I began in Windhoek, went to Namib-Naukluft National Park to see Sossusvlei and Dead Vlei, then continued on to Swakopmund, then Etosha National Park for a safari, before heading back to Windhoek.  There was just one other person along for the tour, so it was almost like a private trip, which was really nice because I didn't have to be part of a big group.

Our guide, Augustinus (Augy), was very knowledgeable and accommodating. The lodges were among the best accommodation we have ever stayed in.

Jill D,"Guangzhou, China",15 days safari tour in Tanzania,"We started our tour in Arusha (Tanzania) with our guide Malliy, who was amazing! We went from Tarangire, were we saw already a lot of animals & the baobab trees, which were impressive, to Lake Eyasi, where we met 2 tribes, which was a very special experience. After this, we went to Serengeti and Ngorongoro. We already went on a Safari in Namibia two years ago, but Namibian safari is not comparable to Tanzania! We were so surprised of how many animals and animal rituals we saw and how close we were to those animals. We felt very safe and trusted Malliy 100%, he was a very good driver & also a very good & experienced guide, who could provide us with an answer on everything. Sense of Africa was flexible in changing our itinerary, we were supposed to go west of Serengeti to see the migration, but because the drought of the last months, the wildebeests already moved to the North, so they changed our itinerary to camps in the North. Also when our flight from Zanzibar to Dar was advanced, they picked us up in Dar to still go with us to a restaurant in town so that we should not have to wait too long in the airport of Dar. One downside, 2 members of our family arrived 2 days later because of an ear infection, we didn't receive any refunds, not even for the NPs that were paid when entering the park or any of the hotels (none of them seemed fully booked). Moreover, we needed to pay for an extra room the first night + needed to pay a lot of money from the transfer from Arusha to Karatu.",19-Jul-24,,Okaukuejo waterhole

It was 18 wonderful days with each day better than the one before.  We chose Namibia as it has so much to offer.   Namibia is the safest country in Africa and there are numerous wildlife opportunities including the outstanding Etosha.  The varied geography includes the Kalahari and Namib deserts, the world's oldest sand dunes, the second largest canyon in the world, the Skelton Coast, and the wet lands in the Caprivi Strip.  The people are friendly and include such interesting people as the Himba and Sans Bushmen.  We especially enjoyed our visit to the outstanding Ghost Town of Kolmanskop.     After reviewing a number of tour companies we chose WWS and it more than exceeded our expectations.  Our guide Philip, has a great personality and is very knowledgeable about the wildlife, geography, and cultures of Namibia and answered all our questions.

The air in the deserted streets carries no hint of moisture. Life exists solely in the form of isolated stunted shrubs eking out a living; testing the limits of survival.

Joao P,"Lisbon, Portugal",NTS support on Namibia & Vic Falls 13 day trip,"Namibia Tours & Safaris (NTS) helped set up a 13 day trip to Namibia and Vic Falls. We were a party of 6 with two children (7 and 11).The overall support was bellow our expectations. The trip was really amazing  and in the end all went well: not only the animals and the scenery were unforgettable but flights were on time, lodges were either good or excellent, nobody got sick and there were no accidents of any kind.Namibia Tours Safaris did put effort into helping us on this trip, but I must confess that we were not fully happy with the NTS's service.I state some concrete examples1. We were told by NTS that we had to leave Victoria Falls hotel after two nights and move to the Kingdom Hotel (a major downgrade and a significant hassle). This need for change really upset the whole group. We were told by NTS that Victoria Falls Hotel had no room available. This was not the case: there were sufficiently rooms available as we could confirm online days before we started and at the counter of the VFHotel. Since we had already paid for the Kingdom Hotel we were not ready to spend the extra money.2. We were told by NTS that all the hotels in Namibia would be on the GPS of the rented car. That was not the case for the Elegant Lodge, the Toshari Lodge and the Okutala Lodge. This led to a significant waste of time searching for the lodges. This was particularly bad in Sossusvlei were we drove back and forth for one hour in gravel roads, since nobody in the car could understand the cryptic directions for the hotel that were on NTS's documentation (even though the hotel has a very clear map on its brochure, as we found out once we arrived)3. The rooms at the Hilton were not reserved for the correct dates: had we not confirmed beforehand each and all of the reservations we would risk arriving at Windhoek without a place to stay. 4. In Toshari and Okutala and in the Kingdom we were given two family units, even though we asked for one family unit and a double room. Typically double rooms are less expensive than family units, so it is possible we overspent unnecessarily.5. Related to the last point: we could not understand from the invoice what was the cost of the service provided by NTS and what was the cost of the lodges, transfers etc. In our (extensive....) experience with other travel agencies, these two are separate and allow for a correct assessment of the cost/value of the travel agency service and all other services acquiredThere are more issues both on the real advisory value provided by NTS; NTS process management and the costs of the services purchased. If NTS management is interested I can provide it offline.Evidently with many of the group's elements having lived in Subsaharan Africa for several years we could manage through all of this ""with a leg behind our back"". But if the trip was a success it was not because but despite NTS. All in all NTS service was below our expectations.This is truly a 2: the effort and undeniable sympathy of the NTS team that helped us cannot mask the factual lack of performance.JoÃ£o",6-Aug-17,Family,Namib Desert
Joburg_boy,"Dunkeld West, South Africa",Great Trip to Sandwich Harbour,"On Friday 29 September my wife, Robin, and I spent six hours travelling to Sandwich Harbour on your tour.

An expert on most matters relevant to the environment and the journey, we learnt a great deal from him. The scenery was amazing. Isolated, majestic, eternal. We saw some wild life, and learnt about the local bird life. Wintonâs driving was expert, and we negotiated the steep dune downhill drives smoothly, not too many eyes tightly closed! Winton made sure we integrated well with the other people on the tour, and we all had an uproarious time! Please use this testimonial for your tour company, and for Winton himself.

JOE A,"McMurray, PA",Gold Medal Performance,"My wife and I recently completed a 16 day Namibia, Okavango Delta, Chobe, & Victoria Falls private guided safari arranged by Bianca Gellert.  Bianca was always very responsive to and patient with my many questions and requests over the 5 months of initial planning that went into the tour.  The tour content was excellent and and the pace, although fast, was exactly what we desired.  But what really made this tour exceptional, was the quality of the guide provided for our tour.  Augustinus Gawiseb has got to be one of the best guides out there!  Augustinus is the total package you should be looking for in a private guide.  Foremost, he is a safe driver and that should be your number one priority for driving around Namibia and Botswana on mostly unpaved roads. We felt like royalty with Augustinus driving us around in our comfortable late model Toyota SUV with A/C while we saw others riding in the back of open air safari vehicles wrapped up in blankets in the morning and sweating the 35 C temperature in the afternoon.  But the thing that impressed me most about Augustinus, was his in depth knowledge of nature, animals, birds, Namibian Culture, and his command of five languages.  If you are a ""birder"" you will want Augustinus to be your guide.  A great personality, patient, courteous, and a true professional.   I strongly recommend using a driver/guide for this tour rather than a self drive.  Leave the driving to a professional so you can watch the scenery go by and rest assured that you are on the right road and will arrive safely.  If tour planning and guiding were an Olympic event, the team of Namibia Tours and Safaris, Bianca,  and Augustinus would certainly be a strong contender for the gold medal.",3-Oct-16,Couples,Namib Desert

From the arrival point it is a 1km walk over dunes before arriving at Deadvlei. Our entire journey was worth it for the experience. The river flooded the area many year ago which made the camel-thorn trees grow. Over the year the dunes cut off any further water to the area and the trees died. The  extreme heat and dry weather caused the trees to be preserved. This was the highlight of our trip.,16-Aug-16,Couples,Otjikoto Lake

Sammy was an invaluable resource during the trip, making quick modifications when requested and even leaving some treats for our kids in the hotel.There was a minor hiccup with the airport transfer from Windhoek, but it was quickly remedied.

Our guide was safe, enthusiastic and totally caring about our experience. The scenery was beyond beautiful. Every stop we made provided a unique experience or a fantastic view. The dunes were FUN! We loved the roller coaster experience of being at the top of the dune looking down. I want to add that the actual car moving/sliding down the dune felt amazingly gentle. The included snack was more than enough for a meal. It was impressive to look at and everything was delicious. It included about six different items to eat and two dessert bites. Plenty of beverages were offered, including beer and cider. The little souvenir we were able to gather, both pink and dune sand in a little bottle to take home, was a great addition.

To describe this service as chaotic would be an understatement and results in large groups of people abandoned in the heat at various locations. When the shuttle turns up only the fit and able are first to get to it and the less so miss out. I am surprised to learn that no cases of heat stroke or even death have yet occurred.

Before going there it may be hard to fully comprehend how well organised, safe and easy is to drive around the country and visit it on your own car and specially how magnificent it is. As you can tell  my experience in Namibia was positive all around and in large part this was thanks to this tour company which helped me organised our tour throughout Namibia. It included flights to Sousussvlei, an air baloon over the desert, amazing lodges, tours, excursions and obvoiusly our car rental. The booking process and the interactions with Tanya were friendly and proffessional. She responded quite quickly to my queries and reassured my doubts when presented. The advices regarding choosing lodges and locations to visit were pertinent and accurate. I didn't feel like I was pushed to get more expensive thing just to drive up her profits, which gave me lots of confidence in the company while organising the tour. We were given a thourought briefing upon arrival at the airport, our planning worked out perfectly and the car drop off was efficient.I can't say it enough, Namibia is such an amazing country, visit it and explore it because it is so beautiful and surprising. Go there with your kids and go there with your healthy elderly, they will enjoy it!The only thing I could point out as a reccommendation regarding the booking process is that it would have been helpful to have been given a detailed or structured chart of the costs of every item included on the safari as to make it easier to decide what to take in and leave out. In the end we got the trip we wanted, it was without fault and it all worked out perfectly.",23-Jun-17,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole
Joseph102,"Angola, Lubango",Little Concern for Clients,"We toured Namibia for two weeks with SOA covering almost 2500 miles. However, for the first week of the trip, fifteen persons were crammed into an airport transfer vehicle with no leg room, no reclining seats and very uncomfortable. I booked this trip almost one year in advance only to be told upon arrival that there were no SOA vehicles available and the rented van was to be our vehicle. This management decision reflects a complete lack of concern for the wellbeing of their customers. An airport transfer vehicle is not an appropriate means to take 15 people and their luggage on a 2500 mile tour. My recommendation for any customer using SOA is to obtain a guarantee prior to their trip that they will be provided a suitable vehicle for their tour. Namibia is a beautiful country  and if you make this long journey, the tour operator must be more responsible to assure that your journey is memorable.  In our case, I feel that SOA just did not provide proper care for us.",16-Sep-24,,Etosha_Pan

We took a self drive safari in Namibia that was budget friendly to higher star lodge safaris in Botswana. Marcel was able to accommodate where we wanted to stay and when for a price that was better than what we could organise ourselves. Worth paying the commission to a top notch outfit like NTS, they know what they are doing and did a great job. Communication along the way was excellent and all of our questions and concerns were answered timely. On our self drive safari, a rock was kicked up by another vehicle chipping our wind screen. No worries about an excess as Marcel already made sure we had windscreen insurance. Attention to detail and experience surely saved us some cash as we did not have to pay anything.

Some of the houses are quite impressive for their time.  It's interesting that the town started to mine copper (none has ever been found) but grew because alluvial diamonds were discovered by accident. The town essentially died when bigger diamonds were discovered in another area. There are apparently still diamonds around, they are however quite small.  And no you cant just walk off with one if found. There are restrictions on where tourist can go.

In 2012, we used their service to organize our trip to Botswana and Victoria Falls.  Edward Taylor was our travel consultant, he did a great job.  Everyone was very happy with the itinerary and the selected camps.  In 2014 we started to organise our trip to Namibia, half way we aborted the plan due to ebola outbreak in Africa.  Although Namibia was not affected at all, we aired on the safe side.  Edward was very graceful when we informed him of our decision despite all the work that he had put in.  I was very impressed with his professionalism.Thus when we wanted to go to Namibia in Jun 2016, we did not look at any other companies; we went straight to Namibia Tours & Safaris, and we were not disappointed.  Edward was efficient and very responsive.  What I liked the most was that he always answered my questions precisely.  The planning was effortless despite we are a group of 7 living in 3 different countries.  Edward also gave us good advices on extra activities that we could sign up and he helped us organize them all.  We were also very happy with our guide/driver, Charl, in our Namibia trip.  Namibia is a beautiful country to visit, there are a lot to see, apart from wildlife and the traditional safari game drives, their deserts and coastline are absolutely stunning.  We spent a day visiting Sosussvlei, climbing Big Daddy, one of their many famous sand dunes, it was a challenge, but the view on the top looking into Deadvlei and the endless deserts was well worth it.   In Swakopmund we signed up for the Sandwich Harbor 4x4 excursion, we had a blast despite windy and overcast weather.

In summary, a wonderful trip that makes hard to go back home. Just be aware of the dirt roads: do not speed when taking a curve or else you may get into serious trouble...",12-Aug-15,Family,Dune 45

Judy Chan,"Toronto, Canada",Spectacular and Unique Namibia,"It's a shame Tripadvisor won't let me give Namibia Tours & Safaris more than 5 stars, because our tour to Namibia was beyond excellent.  Our consultant Ashlee is so wonderful.  She helped me learn about Namibia and its delights, and designed an amazing custom guided safari for three of us, twice!  Ashlee was so positive and accommodating and just downright sweet.  She is also very experienced and knowledgeable â she knew what we needed to do before we did.  She knew that we needed to visit Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, Twyfelfontein, Palmvag, Etosha and Okonjima.   She knew we needed to kayak with the seals in Walvis Bay, that we needed to do a tour of the dunes in Sandwich Harbour, with Sandy Horizons (fantastic!), that we should stay at Okakuejo Lodge in Etosh, to be close to that waterhole (indescribable!), that we should stay at Okonjima Bush Camp (wow!), and that we would hit it off with our guide.And what can we say about our guide, Zane Volker?  He is an exceptional guide.  He introduced us to Nambia and instilled in us, a permanent affection for this varied and magnificent county.  Zane is incredibly knowledgeable about all parts of the country, its history, geography and geology.  And in a country like Namibia, which appears to have invented geology, thatâs pretty darn important.  He knows the behaviour, biology and the soul of all the wildlife, from the largest elephant to the smallest dik dik, from the common Springbok (Springbok!), to the rarest black rhino and bat eared fox.  And man, does he have a keen eye!  He was the first to see every leopard we saw on the trip.  He is a fierce conservationist and at the same time, extremely respectful of and knowledgeable about the people who live amongst the animals.  Itâs evident in everything he says and does, that Zane loves animals, loves people, loves the bush and loves Africa.  And that love is contagious.Zane is immeasurably experienced, entertaining (fabulous stories of the bush), helpful (we didnât have to do any of our lodge check ins), tolerant (of our never-ending questions), calm (in the face of many lost sunscreen or photography crises), intuitive (thanks for the scotch at the sundowners!), clever (âthe last straw that broke the back of the camelthornâ), a great communicator, fantastic company (âGo Springboks!â) a hell of a driver, and quite frankly, the hands down, best guide we have ever had the pleasure of knowing.  And most of all, just an all-round great guy.  (Zane spent his day off, after our tour was over, driving us around so we could buy a new suitcase). Truthfully, we met Zane as a guide, but we said goodbye to him, as a forever friend.We loved Nambia, in no small part because of Ashlee and Zane.  The only regret that we have is that we didnât book a longer trip, so that we could have seen more of this spectacularly diverse country.  So, we will definitely be back, and we will definitely be calling Ashlee and Zane to make that happen!Gesondheid!Judy Chan and Grant Cripps, and Mark Benton - Toronto, Canada",24-Nov-23,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

julians730,"London, UK",Full marks for Namibia and NT&S,"Weâre (two couples) recently returned from a 16-day self-drive (with one âfly-inâ leg) trip to Namibia organised by Bianca Jordaan at NT&S.  Nine locations plus our last night in Windhoek.Weâre blown away on two counts, first we just loved Namibia and canât wait to return, second, what a pleasure to do a trip like this where all the arrangements worked out so perfectly and where everything, vehicle, camps, lodges, activities exceeded our expectations. This was a full-on trip, we covered circa 2,700 km (excluding game drives at the camps) and participated in all the camp organised game drives that we could. Sharing the driving, enjoying the ever-changing landscapes and stopping for wildlife all made it really enjoyable and surprisingly relaxing. Namibia is a huge country and this trip has really wetted our appetite to see more of it. In a trip with so many highlights itâs hard to single out any one destination or activity but I guess a few experienes that will stay with us are Sossusvlei and the Dunes, the Skeleton Coast so rugged and desolate, Campe Kipwe so perfectly blended into the rocky hillside you almost donât know itâs there, The Sky at night, awesome, spectacular sun sets, Etendeka Mountain Camp, at one with nature,  Ongava Tented Camp, the Bush dinner was unreal, Onguma Tented Camp â âthe place you never want to leaveâ and of course the wild life, just everywhere and oh so natural, the Zebra, Giraffe, White and Black Rhino just to name a few, a Cheetah and three cubs on the plain in Etosha, a large herd of Elephants at Klein Namutoni,  the Cheetah and Leopard at Africat â Okonjima and I almost forgot the Pangolin!Planning and organisation was meticulous from start to finish, NT&S supplied a detailed itinerary with accurate distances and travel times, lots of specific and general information on each destination, comfortable and robust 4x4 vehicle supplied with pre-programmed sat-nav and local mobile phone.  Bianca was a pleasure to deal with. She was attentive, constructive, understood what we wanted, communicated efficiently and truly worked with us to deliver this fantastic trip.   Thank you so much. Anyone whoâs planning a trip to Namibia, look no further for your travel arrangements, we have no hesitation in recommending NT&S.",6-Jun-18,Couples,Waterberg National Park
Julie C,"Terranora, Australia",Impressive rock formations,"Spitzkoppe is a group of bald granite peaks in the Namib Desert. The highest outcrop (Gross Spitzkoppe) is 1,728 m and is also known as the Matterhorn of Africa because of its pointy peak. The peaks stand out dramatically from the flat surrounding plains and are a little akin to the Kata-Tjuta (Olgas) in Australia. The outcrops cover a large area and have a number of interesting formations. After paying the entry fee at the gate, drive to the southern camping area where there is a large rock pool up in the rocks. Further on is the larger of two bridges in the park. There are a number hyrax or rock dassies here, which are closely related to the elephant. Walk up the rocks to the bridge (by crouching under the hangover) and take lots of photos. It is a great view of the whole area including the Pontok Mountains. If you drive west past the Pontok Mountanis, through more interesting rock formations, and between Sugarloaf (1285m) and Gross Spitzkoppe you come to another campsite. Further north there is an area with rock art and another pool and bridge, but you need a permit and guide to go there.",11-Jul-19,Couples,Otjikoto Lake
Julie C,"Terranora, Australia",Easy climb on sand dune,"The inland road between Swakopmund and Walvis Bay goes straight past Dune 7, about 10 km east of Walvis Bay. Dune 7 in Dorob National Park is reportedly the tallest sand dune in Namibia. The easiest place to climb this one on the left hand end but those who like a challenge can climb it elsewhere. It was easier than at Sossusvlei â not as steep or narrow. Best to climb in bare feet.",12-Jul-19,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp

The museum, restaurant, old gym and also worth looking at, but climbing in and out of the un-restored buildings, through windows now almost filled with sand was great fun.

I will review the things we did separately however Bianca did a first class job with our arrangements. Everything went seemlessly. She was great to deal with and responded quickly to all our requests. On the ground we were looked after well by the various companies she had arranged our transfers with. We had no waiting - in fact they had to wait for us at times, when we arrived late a couple of times due to delays.

Immanuel Wilderness Lodge, Windhoek (1 night)2.	Okonjima Luxury Bush Camp (2 nights)3.	Mushara Lodge (west Etosha) (3 nights)4.	Ongava Lodge (2 nights)5.	Mowani Mountain Camp, Damaraland (2 nights)6.

Jen was so helpful, answering my constant stream of questions and tweaking the itinerary until it was exactly what we wanted.A âdoor-to-doorâ service was provided with several thoughtful and useful touches. We were collected at the airport so that we didnât need to drive after a long flight. The hire car was handed over to us at our first accommodation on the outskirts of Windhoek so that we didnât need to go back into the city to collect it. They gave us a half hour lesson on how to change the tires (just in case!) and how to operate a 4x4. We were met at the airport at the end of the trip so that we could simply drive ourselves to the airport and hand over the car keys. Thanks Jen! That was a great trip.

katCardiff,"Cardiff, UK",Awesome!,"Sossusvlei was one of many highlights of our trip around Namibia. Huge dunes and so scenic. We climbed Big Daddy, which was totally worth it for the jaw dropping view of the dune network stretching for hundreds of kilometres and views over Deadvlei. As we did it in August the heat wasnât a massive issue. The climb is really not that bad. Itâs a bit of a hike and steep in some places but itâs doable for most people and very much worth it. Take your time and soak up the views on the way. I do recommend taking lots of water though! Even in August itâs pretty hot and it is a climb. We didnât take enough and regretted it. Take 3 litres if you can carry it on a hot day. The nearest place to buy water is at the park entrance 65km away so best be prepared! There is a Parking spot approx 5km from Big Daddy and Deadvlei. You can walk in from here. For those with a 4x4 you can drive it, but be aware it is deep sand and not easy to drive. We got briefly stuck ð but managed the rest of the way.

The day we visited, there was a strong wind, so we were somewhat sandblasted by the time we got there. (It sticks to suntan lotion, so we looked like sandpaper by the time we got back to the car.) It was a little crowded when we arrived, but it's worth waiting until the main crowds disperse a little and there are always camera angles which minimise the inclusion of other people. We were at the gates when they opened and drove straight through at 7am, not stopping to buy the permit. You can buy the permit on your way out, they don't seem to object as long as you pay before you leave, (they asked us if we were on our way in or on our way out), but you have the advantage of seeing more of the shadows and patterns of sunrise, instead of wasting part of that time in the queue for permits. We took the NWR shuttle from the main carpark, rather than our own 4x4, and we were glad we did, as we saw others bogged down in the soft sand.

Afterwards, we explored the structures on our own. I recommend sticking it out for the long haul - a ton of people were wandering the same houses right behind the main building making it more difficult to take photos in isolation. I think most people peter out after an hour, but we stuck around longer and explored farther to the single-men and family barracks as well as the hospital, and had those settings to ourselves for photos. You can finish in as little as 1.5 hours or take as long as 4 if you want! There were some nice brightly colored walls for photo opportunities too.

We did not arrive at sunrise but did not feel like this impacted our experience.We spent about 1 1/2 hours there.  We didn't climb all the way to Big Daddy, but got 3/4 of the way there, and ran down.  Nice vistas.

Katie N,"New York City, NY",Beautiful but go early in the day,"The hike up Big Daddy takes about an hour to an hour and a half and is completely worth it if you're in the shape to do it.  Start early in the day (best if you can get to the park right when it opens since it takes another 45 minutes or so to get to the Big Daddy area - and you need a 4x4 to get to the main staging area, from which you need to walk another km or so to get to the bottom of the dune) before the sun heats up the sand too much.  Take plenty of water and perhaps a snack - the sand sinks under your feet making it a tougher hike up than you would think.  It is a bit easier if a few people have already started up since you can step in their tracks.  The view from the top is spectacular, and the best part is the descent - you run down the side of dune right into Deadvlei.  Dune 45 is likely a good alternative if (1) you aren't in good shape, (2) you don't have a 4x4 and don't want to wait for a tractor shuttle or (3) you don't get to the park until after the sun has been up for a while.",21-Feb-18,Couples,Dune 45

I visited the area three times and found something to buy each time.The area can be entered from several directions. Look for the big 77 on Independence Road and enter through the walkway underneath. Or go from the other side of the block under the deck of the Craft Cafe. The Namibia Craft Centre itself is a labyrinth of ""stores"" on several levels. That is where the cafe is. Other shops in the area had souvenir items as well - it's worth taking a look in each one. Some things are similar but some specialize in other items. The Diamond Works is also in this area. It was interesting to see how diamonds, settings and other jewelry items were made. You can take a short tour there and learn quite a bit.There are a few other eateries/bars in the area but we found them too smoky. Prices are generally the same in all the stores but the two shops across from Diamond Works had a bit higher prices and the stores were a little more upper class.

Once you get to the end of the paved road and park you pay 170 pp to take the 4x4 truck to the start of the trek to the salt flat.  You donât have to walk up the dune, we just walked to the right of the crowd and were able to get to the salt flats without the arduous dune walk.  There are actually 3 different areas with the dead trees.  A friend and I were able to sit in one of the lesser visited flats and enjoy the sights while enjoying a small packed lunch.The toilets donât have doors and theyâre pretty gross. Take loads of sunscreen and water and it gets quite hot. If you forget your water in the car as we did, you can ask one of the tour operators for some.

Keith P,"Southwest Finland, Finland",High historical value but for how much longer...,"Without a doubt this heritage site has arguably some of the best rock engravings that date allegedly, from pre-biblical times to 1000 AD. Sadly the site is a collection rock falls and broken examples of the hunter-gatherers' art. Many more must have been lost or remain hidden under the piles of debris, and those that are visible appear to be left to whatever erosion nature will apply. There are four routes that visitors can take depending on the individuals interest and capabilities (they are not suitable for wheelchairs and buggies) and along each the carving examples are clearly visible and accessible - even to those that feel the need to record their own personal attendance. The visitor centre could be upgraded a little and I suspect that some new buildings will be erected in time for this years high season.

Kelly R,"Reno, NV",Unforgettable WOW experience,"I'm a slow hiker and it took me about 1.5 hours to get to the top. We entered the park as soon as the gates opened, 1 hour before sunrise. However, to get in an hour before sunrise you must spend the night at Sesriem camp (book in advance online to ensure a campsite). Also, be sure you have a 4x4 to drive in the sand to get to the deadvlei parking lot.  We went in June and the sand conditions were ideal for driving.  We were the first people to the top of Big Daddy and had the summit and the 360 degree views all to ourselves for about an hour. We stayed at the top (quite windy, so take layers) and enjoyed watching the shadows and light change throughout the morning. At around 11:30 we saw the shadows and light align perfectly along the dune and Deadvlei below. It was gorgeous! We ran down the dune running and jumping in the sand. So fun!

From where this transport drops you it is a 15 minute or so walk across the sand, which is mainly flat until you drop down into the Dead Pan.

As whilst itâs an excellent stopping off point half way between Etosha and Windhoek, it takes about 45mins off the main road to reach them which means your activity options are time limited but as their centre is designed to enable you to see some of their cheetahs without having to go out on activities you have the flexibility to arrive anytime during their 8-5pm opening times with their cafe also open the same times. Their lodge is small and the whole place feels far less commercial and much more flexible with their activities than Africat, so we would definitely stay again if going to Etosha.

Sticking out of the lake bed were trees, all randomly placed and in varies states of âdeadâ.  It looked like you had iced a cake and wanted some twigs sticking out of it!

Kevin S,"Swansea, UK",FANTASTIC DAY OUT - EDUCATIONAL,"The sand had eaten the floor boards and was crawling up the walls of most of the houses, their windows and doors having been broken or forced open by the invading menace, the Namibian desert was slowly taking over this once booming diamond rush town called Kolmanskop. 10 kilometres out of LÃ¼deritz âin the middle of nowhereâ stands a living monument to those who toiled for riches in the early nineteen hundreds.  Annie and I trudged through the sand retracing the history of those once pioneers/prospectors, savouring in the zen like atmosphere, leaving foot prints that were quickly to disappear with the ever present wind which was whistling over the surrounding dunes, a fine mist spray atop its crest.  Once grandeur houses have been overtaken by the sands of time, exquisitely paint stencilled and rag rolled âwall paperâ hangs majestically and delicately in places, frozen in time, but fragile - one gust of wind in the wrong direction would ruin the suspended paint fragments somehow clinging to the wall, to âliveâ for another day.Latchless windows waver too and fro and bang, their once polished glass panes lie shattered amongst the sand carpet, only small shards defiantly remain, forever puttied into their wooden paint flaked frames.  The earieness of a ghost town (which it is billed as) does not exist, just sad old Edwardian German style buildings sitting is a desert wasteland with its once bustling life and soul slowly being ripped out since its closure in 1954.From the owners palatial houses to those of the workers, there is a stark difference, but forever explicitly linked, as the sand takes no prisoners and all the ex-residents houses are fare game for home invasion.  What a bleak desolate place this is.Roll top baths, some beautifully enamelled others plain white, were all filled with the Kallahari forming ripples where water once filled, these were the only furniture that was abandoned in these otherwise stark empty houses.  Electrical sockets, light switches and fuse panels having been wretched off the walls for recycling, their only existence highlighted by the red and black cables that dangle menacingly âliveâ.The very long empty hospital corridor was silent and still, all itâs patients have long gone, now itâs only inhabitants are the ever encroaching sands and small four legged animals that have left their incriminating footprints.  The only other recent inhabitants have been the local youths of the 20th century, who have also left their mark, by means of the multitude of scratched graffiti onto the once pristine painted alabaster walls and âfinger writtenâ onto one of the 9 remaining frosted panes of glass (still intact) in the ornate windowed panelled door!Physically, there is not a lot is left here, except the slowly deteriorating decrepit buildings, but if the walls could talk . . . what a fantastic history lesson would unfold about the men, the women, the children and their daily toils and hardship.Here, the term sand blasted takes on a whole new meaning.",23-Sep-18,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

All campsites were excellent with most of them having shower and bathroom facilities for each campsite.

We probably saw over 1000 animals as we drove 5000 km.  Scenery in Namibia was impressive even the dry areas without much vegetation.  The watering holes in Etosha were amazing with hundreds of animals stopping by each day. The first and last days, we drove on beautiful asphalt roads.  The rest of the time we were on gravel roads in various conditions.  Some were great with fast, smooth rides.  Others were really rough with challenging washboard roads for long stretches.  Namibia Tours & Safaris reserved seven nights at very nice hotels and eleven nights at very nice campgrounds.  We had no issues with any of the places that we stayed.

kotw46,Florida,"Great cultural experience plus dunes, waterfalls and safaris","My wife and I spent a fantastic 15 days in August 2016 on tour of Namibia with Wild Wind Safaris, with its office in Windhoek, Namibia. Our tour guide was Philip, who, along with his wife Martha, owns the company. We decided to go by car (Philip drove us in a Volkswagen van) and not to fly from location to location within Namibia, in spite of the long distances. Although some of the drives were quite long and probably 75-80% of the 4600 km (2850 miles) that we traveled was on often bumpy dirt and gravel roads, we would have missed a lot of visual and cultural experiences if we had flown from one site to the next. We wanted to have a good sampling of Namibia, including cultural experiences, observation of some unusual natural beauty of Namibia, and animal safaris. Philip was extremely flexible in designing our itinerary to meet our needs. Philip was an outstanding guide. He knew all of the right places to go, where to shop for food and other supplies, where to stop for lunches, how to find and interact with the people we wanted to meet and observe, and he was flexible about stopping for photos along the way. We asked for 2-3 star accommodations, and that is what we got, with clean rooms and comfortable beds. However we would like to give a special shout-out to Fiume Lodge near Grootfontein, where we stayed for our visit to Bushmanland. The owner was very friendly and obviously proud of his gem â only 9 cabins and a nearby camp area, a waterhole with several animals much of the time, and the big surprise to us of actual gourmet cooking with beautiful presentation (kudu schnitzel and wonderful pastry shell appetizer one night and oryx stroganoff the next night, with excellent desserts). We started our tour by going from Windhoek airport to the Sossousvlei area to view the magnificent dunes, then drove north, where we had a brief introduction to the Damara culture (staged but still very interesting and not hokey), then had an opportunity to walk through Twyfelfontaine with its large numbers of excellent ancient petroglyphs/rock carvings. We then drove to Himba and Herero areas. We actually went into several small Himba villages and had an opportunity to interact very closely with Himba people who welcomed us to their villages, and into their huts, explained their way of life to us through nonverbal explanations and some translation via Philip, allowed us to take as many photos as we desired, and the adults and children enjoyed seeing the photos on our cameras (I wish we had taken a small photo printer to give them copies). We then went to Epupa Falls, which is beautiful and quite spectacular even though we were there in dry season. From there we went to Ruacana Falls, which we were told in advance might not have any water flowing over the falls at that time of year and that was the case. However, this was a midway stopping point anyway on the way to the land of the San (Bushmen), where we had an opportunity to visit a village with a staged (but again interesting, informative and not hokey) series of demonstrations of their life and culture. We made a specific point of purchasing souvenirs and gifts in the Damaraland and Bushmanland villages, where everything was actually made by the villagers, and the specific artisans/craft producers benefited from our purchases. The final portion of our trip included 3 days in Etosha National Park, 1 day at Waterberg Plateau, and 1 day at Erindi Private Reserve. Etosha was quite good but with some long spells of no animal sightings interspersed with spectacular viewings (huge bull elephants and herds of elephants with juveniles  and babies, a family of 4 white rhinos, quite a few black rhinos, many giraffes, ostriches, warthogs, jackals, plenty of zebras, oryx, kudus, springboks, impalas, a couple of hyenas, and even an aardvark in daytime). Waterberg Plateau was disappointing, with almost no animals seen on a park drive except a few buffalo at an artificial waterhole. Erindi was superb, and we wished that we had spent another 1-2 days there â excellent bungalow next to a waterhole with hippos, crocodiles, warthogs, kudus, wildebeest, ostriches, and several bird species, including a couple of owls. We stopped at a large market area on the way back to Windhoek, where we had opportunity to pick up our last minute gifts and souvenirs from some of the more than 50 small tented shops, and although it is certain that many of the items were not made locally and most of the wooden items and many of the garments/tapestries were not handmade, the shop proprietors certainly needed the money that we spent there. We spent our final night in a delightful guesthouse in Windhoek and had a delightful and superb dinner out with Philip and Martha. We would highly recommend Wild Wind Safaris.",9-Oct-16,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

The hotels and lodges were great. The vehicle was a converted 4x4 which served us well on all the different terrains. The guide, Ronnie, was fantastic and made us feel at home in Namibia!We were emailed a detailed itinerary and upon arrival and were given hard copies of it as well.

Kurt E,"Central Norway, Norway",Some pratical reflections if you are planning to visit,"If we could do it againt, we would do the following; we had a 4x4 vehicle,and after looking online we were anxious about getting stuck in the sand. The very funny lady at the park entrance said; ""you are not going to get stuck, that is why you are going to take the shuttle-bus"". Against her good advice, we decided to continue driving after we got to the H2 parkinglot. We had deflated our tires at the service station outside the park entrance to 1,6 bar - and we put the Hilux in H4 lowgear once we reaced sandy sections. As long as you do not stop and aim for the part of the road where there is least sand, you`ll be fine. A tip for climbing Big Daddy is to keep left when you walk from the last H4 parkinglot, following the flat bed to the left of Big Mamas ridgeline before starting on Big Daddy. This saves you having to climb Big Mama first, as you have to decend about 1/3 of the height again before starting Big Daddy. You can go directly down from the top of Big Daddy and down into Dead Vlei, so visit here on your return. Bring enough water and sunscreen, and wear closed shoes and ancle high socks as the sand gets warm, the view from the top is worth the walk up there.",5-Aug-18,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

They've been helpful even before I booked the tour and answered all the questions I had at the time. Then the tour started. They picked me up at my hotel at Windhoek and the roadtrip began. There were days when we spent a lot of time on the bus, but it never got dull as the scenes changed from day to day. We also made a lot of breaks so that we were able to stretch our legs and enjoy the panorama.  We were lucky to have Gerda and Nico as guide and driver. They provided a lot of information and were really nice and fun to be with. Nico was also a very good driver, which was a gooOood thing as the roads in Namibia can be quite challenging, to say the least. The lodges were comfortable, some were even luxurious. Sometimes in the middle of nowhere which was highly appreciated, as it allowed us to take the nature in, watch the Milky Way, have a nice evening chat around the fire,...Another positive side of this tour is that we weren't too many on it. This allowed us to get to know each other and bond in a way it is impossible to when the group is larger. The nature in Namibia is really quite something and if Etosha is the highlight regarding wildlife, not one day passed by without spotting one animal or another. All in all I can only recommend this company and Gerda & Nico. Had a great time!!!Thank you!!!",17-Aug-24,,Desert Explores

Itâs worth it to sit and watch the sunrise hitting spitzkoppe     To feel the utter peace and quiet at sunset. You cannot absorb the utter peace by only doing a day visit. Camping in the desert was awesome. You need to be self sufficient as you get a camp spot a toilet somewhere near and a garbage bin. Showers are available but are a drive or hike from the camp spots. The sites are big. I recommend not being against spitkoppe but a site that you can view it  from in the changing light. June us winter it wasnât cold. Cool at night and hot in the day.

Upon meeting Mr. Kamwanga, he was pleasant and engaging and his sculptures were whimsical. I purchased a tin warthog sculpture and a bead lizard, which was intended to be a Christmas present for my grand daughter.The agreement was that I pay Morris David Kamwanga to mail the items to my home in the US.  After much waiting and back and forth, I finally received the warthog, but he did not mail the lizard.  He stated that the lizard must have gotten lost in shipping, however, it was never sent.After much further back and forth and many promises that he would send off the lizard to me ""the next day"", the next day never arrived.  Morris David then said that he could no longer source the same beads, so he would have to tear apart ""kill"" an existing sculpture to create a new one, but that he would do so and mail it to me.Almost one year later, that sculpture was never mailed.  Subsequent emails were never answered.Needless to say, after a very pleasant trip to Namibia, this transaction remains the low point of my visit.

Later on, we saw much more people climbing up.We are used to hike in the mountains a lot so we thought it was going to be quite easy but climbing a sand dune is quite a difference :-) It really took us one hour to the top. In about 2 thirds of the hike, be prepared for several tens of meters where the edge of the dune widens and it makes it quite hard to walk up there. The sand isnÂ´t trampled down there as it is on the edge so it seems that one step up equals one step down.

Keep in mind this is all out in the open in the full sun so choose the right time to go because to see the carvings you do have to walk for no less than 45 minutes and there is some climbing and walking up a slight mountain. Bring some water and have a pair of sturdy shoes on. If you are in this are and don't go you will have missed something quite amazing. We really enjoyed it and and our guides knowledge did match the research that we had done on the area and added to it.,19-Aug-14,Couples,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve
Leeanne P,"Auckland, New Zealand",Worth a visit,If you visit the Sossusvlei red dunes then you will most likely take a look at the approx 900 year old dead tries in this dried up river.  It's an amazing contrast to the red dunes and worth a look while you are there.  If you go on one of the guided trips to the dunes then it's usually included.,14-Aug-14,Couples,Spitzkoppe
Leeanne P,"Auckland, New Zealand",A fascinating look into the past,We stayed at Twyfelfontein lodge and asked at reception if we could go there on our own.  They indicated we should pay for one of their guides and being new to Namibia we booked with them.  We later discovered we could have driven the few minutes to the entrance and tipped a guide to show us through probably for a quarter of the price we paid.  However our guide was interesting and informative and we really enjoyed looking at the engravings and learning a bit about hunter gatherers and nomadic bushmen who drew them quite a few thousands of years ago.  Of course if you are not interested in this kind of thing then you might not enjoy it.  having said that the desert is an amazing place in itself.  And then there is the remains of David Levin's home that he built after which the area is named and that in itself is an interesting story.  After that we went to Burnt mountain and Organ pipes both of which were a bit disappointing.,15-Aug-14,Couples,Namib-Naukluft National Park

NWR staffs provides a short 4WD to the deadvlei parking lot at less than 200rand/pp. It was a short ride, and the breeze on the ride was a great relief from the mid-afternoon heat. As the sun was scorching in the day (despite being winter), we highly recommend bringing lots of water, wear a cap and shades for the 1.1km walk into Deadvlei! Also, wear hiking socks that would cause abrasion to your feet! There were only a few people present at Deadvlei at that time of the day (roughly 2pm). So if you can bear the heat and want to avoid the crowd, going there when the sun is up is not such a bad thing after all! Not forgetting good camera for the picturesque scenery of Deadvlei.

We then had an excellent lunch which was vegetarian, a rare experience for Namibia, and then at 2pm we went to see the cheetahs having their lunch, they were each given their own piece of meet and again a clear explanation was given on what was happening and why, it also enable us to get some great photographs.

Leocrewe,"Crewe, UK",First class in every respect,"Friends in South Africa had always recommended that we visit Namibia and in November we embarked on a ten-day self drive trip to Etosha. Based in the UK I have always planned my own holiday visits but following the advice of so many people on Trip Advisor I opted to have everything organised by a local company. After careful research I plumped for Namibia Tours and Safaris, a bland name but the reviews and their website met my expectations. I have to say that these were hugely surpassed, as from the first contact everything was first class. Having arranged educational visits myself for over 40 years I am well aware of the importance of thorough preparation, flexibility and trust. I'm pleased to say that this company is a perfect representation of all those qualities. Our contact person was Tessa who made recommendations and suggestions without being pushy and responded promptly, with humour and efficiency, to all the emails she received. In the lead-up to our visit, the news concerning Air Namibia was rather disconcerting, however Tessa allayed our worries with on-the-spot updates and she quickly passed on any relevant information. Ironically it was South African Airways who were on strike when we left Windhoek. The meeting, collection to and from the airport in Windhoek was punctual and friendly. The meet and greet on the first morning with the hire car by Simone and Wayne was extremely thorough and the satellite phone and tracker allayed any worries that we might have still had, even though we werenât venturing into the desert. The extremely comprehensive notes and relevant information were very useful. All the accommodation was exceptional, the food top class and the staff in all the lodges were extremely hospitable, helpful and friendly. Everything went extremely smoothly, Tessa was a pleasure to work with and we are currently singing the praises of Namibia, the food, the people, the wildlife and NTS to all and sundry.",31-Dec-19,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

This Swakopmund based company was very organized and effective. Communication was timely and efficient. We deliberately chose an in country tour group and we received exceptional services, superb accommodations and knowledge responsive staff.Lukas, our guide, was incredibly knowledgeable speaking six languages including several tribal languages. He shared his wealth of knowledge and experience from many years as a local tour guide. All the accommodations were first rate. We spend nine full days on the road visiting the Namib Desert, Soussusvlei, Swakopmund, Damaraland, and Ethosha National Park. Throughout our journey we met local people, shared experiences, and enjoyed a scenic flight over the sand dunes (which I highly recommend) and saw so many animals and birds we lost count. In Etosha, Lukas used his many years as a guide to find just the right spots for animal sightings in the early morning and late afternoon.

Being relatively close to the sea, there are images of seals and penguins as well as the expected, giraffes, rhinos, etc.  The local guide was very well versed in the rock art and open in her descriptions.  It is probably a funding issue, but the visitor center could benefit from a massive overhaul or replacement. It's pretty much a dump.  The facilities are in sad shape.

We incorporated suggestions from Edward Taylor at NTS who then went ahead making the bookings and selection of accommodation.  ALL the 13 establishments selected had good facilities, good food and very friendly and helpful staff.  The itinerary was demanding and involved almost 7000 km of driving.  All very doable and well worth the effort.  A great holiday.Would we do it all again?  You betcha!  We would recommend Namibia Tours and Safaris to anyone.",27-Sep-13,Friends,Namutoni

Lisa H,"Hong Kong, China",Wonderful Namibia Self-drive Trip,"Marcel at NTS helped us organise a 2+ week self-drive trip through parts of Namibia. We did a fairly popular circle from Windhoek down to the Namib desert, then up to Swakopmund, Damaraland and Etosha before returning south to Windhoek via Okonjima.  We had a wonderful time with all locations offering something, whether it be walks, dunes or game, and a variety of accommodation from basic rooms at Okaukuejo in Etosha (but still worth it for the floodlit waterhole!) to luxury at Okonjima.Marcel was very helpful and patient with us as we changed dates and accommodation more than once during the planning of the trip. She arranged all the accommodation and the car hire. We had a Hilux 4x4, although we did not really need the 4WD the higher clearance and better tyres on gravel roads are a good idea. In the dry season 2WD is probably okay for this itinerary but I would go for at least an SUV.  Overall I would be happy to recommend NTS to anyone.",23-Jul-17,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

It also starts at 8am sharp! We just turned up and we're lucky to find someone had pre-booked so could tag along. The cheetahs race after scented rags pulled along at great speed on zip wires akin to what happens in greyhound stadium. It's exhilarating though over far too quickly. The whole thing is over in 30 minutes yet the publicity which accompanied it was somewhat disingenuous claiming there was a 2.5hr tour included. What they meant was that you could wander around the museum at your own pace and linger as long as you like. The museum was quite interesting, though needs upgrading as some of the exhibits are a bit faded and drably presented. It was possible to go on a drive into the enclose for a further Â£25 each but, despite it being a good cause, our budget didn't extend to spending Â£100 on a couple of hours so we satisfied ourselves with the 'run' for Â£25 each.

London,"London, UK",Great experience,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Cheetah Conservation Centre (CC) from 9am until 2:40pm on 21 November 2011. We stayed the night before in Bush Pillow, Otjiwarongo, which is only 40 min drive to CCF on a D2440 gravel road. By the time we got there we were thrilled saw oryx, ostriches and baboons! We have learnt that livelihood of local farmers depends on their livestock, which cheetahs often attack. As a response, farmers kill cheetahs to protect their livestock. CCFâs focus is to minimise this human wildlife conflict and to protect these beautiful animals. This is achieved by educating local communities (including farmers and children) and offering efficient ways to prevent cheetahs attacks (electrified fences and use of the Akbash dogs). It is illegal to breed cheetahs, thus females and males animals are kept separately in CCF. When government officials or farmers bring cheetahs to CCF, some of them are too young and have not learnt hunting/survival skills from their mothers. They remain under CCFâs protection for the remainder of their lives (up to 14 years in captivity, while their natural lifespan in a wild is only 8 years).We started off with learning about cheetahs in the Educational Centre, followed by a tour of main facilities, including clinic and seeing the dogs that are being trained to help local farmers to protect their livestock from cheetah attacks, minimising human wildlife conflict. Then our knowledgeable guide took us on the Elands Cheetah Safari Drive (1 hr in CCF vehicle only), during which we met six out of seven females currently kept there. These animals are used to cars, people and being photographed and we admired them from a close distance, as photos demonstrate.We brought picnic with us (thanks to an advice on this site!) and enjoyed a little break in a picnic area before observing cheetahs being fed in separate groups (youngsters, females and males) over 30 min from 2 pm on a week day (noon over the weekend - please confirm in advance).I know CCF offers another drive and a âCheetah Runâ (at 8am, booking two days in advance is required), but we did not experienced these.More info and feeding times confirmations can be found here http://www.cheetah.org/?nd=ccf_namibia  and http://www.cheetah.org/?nd=visiting_ccf_namibia",22-Jan-12,Solo,Onguma Bush Camp

However, it is evident the animals are very well cared for, have plenty of natural habitat and that they are doing great conservation work.

London,London,Pleasant - worthwhile conservation work,"I was impressed with the work being done by the CCF. It is a successful and worthwhile venture and I would advise visiting if only to support their excellent conservation work.However as a visitor I was a little disappointed- I didn't really learn much about Cheetahs that I didn't already know and I felt that every staff member told us the same couple of facts (most of which were already in the initial information video). They also seemed a bit bewildered when we turned up without a prior booking (We didn't think from their website that it would be necessary but if you're thinking of visiting it might be a good idea).  That said, it is wasn't particularly expensive and it was a pleasant morning activity. It was nice to see the cheetahs close up in their enclosure on the cheetah drive and all the staff do really care about the cheetahs and the project.I would recommend visiting to support the Conservation efforts if you are in the area but unfortunately I wasn't blown away by the experience.",10-Apr-16,Solo,Desert Explores

They also train dogs to act as cattle guards.  We were there at feeding time and went on a brief tour of one of the enclosures where we could get close to cheetahs being prepare to go back into the wild.It is a positive learning experience for children and adults alike but their success rate seems to be rather low and they are having to look after a growing number of animals which for various reasons cannot be returned to the wild.

Los Angeles,"Los Angeles, CA",The best experience of my life so far!,"I just got back from a two week volunteer trip to CCF and all I can say is AMAZING!!!  Every day was better than the day before, I got hands on cheetah interactions daily, got to go out with the cheetah keepers on numerous trips to feed the cheetah and help release 4 males back into the wild.  We also did lab work, read slides to decipher what the wild cheetah's in the area were eating and we took in 3 new cubs from a local farmer who killed their mother.  I have read the reviews below and see that many are only giving a partial story, or they missed much of the cheetah feeding talk, which I also helped with on several occasions. The cheetah are fed from bowls, because in the wild they would be eating out of a carcass and the bowl replicates this environment.  It is also better for the cheetah because they do not ingest large amounts of sand and grass, in the wild they do not eat off the dirt directly since they are eating the inside of a dead animal.  The powder that is on their food is called Predator, it is a vitamin supplement to help them in captivity.  In the wild, they would be eating small soft bones and organs of their kill, getting all those nutrients.  Since it is not possible for them to get all that at CCF they are giving the supplement powder, this is for their health after all. Also, the cheetah who took the food out of the bowl and appeared confused, is most likely the one who gets two bowls as she takes the food from one and got to another, this is a habit she has formed, not confusion.I also think that the folks below who say they expected interaction  were visiting for the feeding alone, as tourist, those groups do not get cheetah interactions, but volunteers and workers do, so plan to spend some time there and you will go away with the most amazing experience you can imagine.The four boys who are being trained to be ambassadors do get daily interaction from people, but for the safety of the tourists CCf can't just let everyone into their area, they are taken to local schools and to farmers for education and to help teach the local farmers not to kill the cheetah.  We also took care of baby goats, a new little of puppies and various other duties. The sleeping quarters and bathrooms are pretty rustic, but worth it for the experiences. I will be back for sure and wish I could have stayed longer.",28-Nov-11,Friends,Swakopmund Museum
Los Angeles,"Los Angeles, CA",Way beyond expectations!,"I knew on paper and from the CCF website that we would have an interesting time there. It was so much more than that!  The staff, to begin with, is made up of the most dedicated professionals one can find anywhere. The 100,000 acre compound is a fascinating study in sustainability. Talk about virtuous circles!  The cheetahs there are either rehabilitated (thanks to CCF's wonderful veterinary clinic), waiting to be rereleased into the wild; cheetahs rescued as babies after their mother had been killed by a farmer protecting his livestock; and cheetahs that have been rehabilitated to the extent possible but not able to be released back into the wild. The way the cheetahs are exercised is worth the trip alone!  In a large open space, a rag is attached to a long wire that moves the rag up to 45 mph. The wire is powered by a truck engine. Cheetahs are cats and the love to chase anything that moves--just like my cat!  Watching the cheetahs power up and race after the rag is simply thrilling!  CCF's Anatolian Shepherd breeding project is fascinating. The dogs live with goats while they are being trained to protect livestock from cheetahs. They are then given to farmers so that they can protect the farmers' livestock from cheetahs, thus dropping the farmer cheetah kills by close to 100%. Then the goats provide the milk for CCF's delicious goat cheese. Best goat cheese ever! I wish I could buy it here. CCF's genetics lab helps keep track of the area's cheetah populations. In a new study of the world's cheetah population, the authors urge that the mere 7,100 cheetahs left in the world be declared an endangered species. At 7,100, critically endangered is what their status should be! CCF is doing more than its share to help restore populations of cheetahs.

Our guide had absolutely nothing to say about the carvings, except to identify which animals were involved, and if I was taking pictures and asked her to repeat it, I received a very disgusted look (after one time asking her to repeat information she refused to even talk if we were taking pictures).

Your tour experience will rest on the quality of your guide and in our experience all the guides at 'Sense of Africa' were excellent but if your guide is Marc you will indeed be fortunate. Not only is Marc knowledgeable about the animals, he has an uncanny eye to spot them at a distance, but his love of Namibia and its history exudes from his being. Sense of Africa will provide you with a truly memorable experience.",17-May-24,Couples,Otjikoto Lake
lovetheunexpected,"Northwich, UK",A must see & do,"The park closes at sunset, of you don't have 4 wheel drive then you will need to use the NWR transport at the far end of the 60 km into the park (tarmaced) . This transport finishes at 4 o'clock for the return back so you need to factor this in. The walk out & up to deadvlei can easily be a couple of hours. So if you're not ealry birds & prefer the early evening light you need to consider these crucial time factors.It is worth it, totally amazing, hard work getting up there but the walk/run down is brilliant.",26-Oct-16,Couples,Namib Desert
LoveToTravel6444,"Greenville, SC",An Incredible 14 Day Trip Through Namibia and Victoria Falls,"We contacted Namibia Tours & Safaris back in late March, and they made an incredible 14-day trip throughout Namibia and to Victoria Falls happen for us in mid July. We were thrilled that they went above and beyond to plan our trip during busy season on relatively short notice. Over the trip, we visited Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, Damaraland, Etosha, and Na'ankuse, as well as Victoria Falls. Ashlee booked great accommodations that met our budget, but allowed for some splurges. We loved Na'ankuse (a wildlife refuge near Windhoek); Mushara Bush Camp near Etosha; Camp Kipwe for the desert-adapted elephants, beautiful sunsets and amazing guide Taffy; and Desert Homestead Outpost near Sossusvlei. In terms of activities, everything was great - from the Sandwich Harbor Excursion in Swakopmund (don't miss it!) to the elephant ride in Vic Falls and the Behind the Scenes tour at Na'ankuse.We did a self-drive tour and were slightly nervous before we got there, but the roads were well-marked and NTS provided a highlighted map and GPS with lodges programmed in there, so we never got lost. We would definitely a recommend a self-drive to anyone considering it. The four-wheel drive was great to have, especially on the dirt and gravel roads (which was most of the trip). We also got to drive to the Deadvlei in the sand with the four-wheel drive, which was a ton of fun. Note for those doing a self-drive - lower your air pressure somewhat on the gravel roads to help prevent flats. Also, cars are typically manual, so if you don't drive a manual, request an automatic upfront when booking. In bigger cities, we noticed that there were guys that would watch your car for you while you were at dinner, etc., for tips. This is perfectly normal. Also, make sure you know about how long of a drive you have each day before hand (Namibia is very big and drives can take a while due to bumpy roads and speed limits), so you don't jam pack too many activities and run out of time to actually drive to your next location/activity. We ended up having to move some activities around halfway through the trip because we realized we didn't have enough time to do everything in one day :) We added on a trip to Victoria Falls at the end, and due to the tight time frame we had, Ashlee set up a charter flight, which was nice to maximize our time in Victoria Falls. We would certainly recommend NTS for the service and help they provided to us!",8-Aug-17,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Luftkrieger,"Rehoboth Beach, DE","I have traveled to many countries, but NAMIBIA will blow your mind away!!!","I did a 13 day trip to Namibia, with the final two days at Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, which was the perfect way to finish this amazing adventure. Daniela Robberts from NTS guided us, step by step, with valuable insights and sensible suggestions regarding places, travelling times and accommodations. She was always very accommodating and extremely prompt to respond, even when I was already in Namibia I needed to get a hold of her.I was picked up by my driver/guide on my second day in Windhoek. She also arranged airport pick-up and drop off. I was presented with presented with a very nice itinerary, map & other important information regarding my trip by manual from our guide Eaze. It was our bible for the trip, providing detailed navigational information, particulars about the countryside we would pass through, vital tips, a list of each lodge with details of types of rooms and meal plan we had prepaid. A detailed map highlighted the route and Eaze will drive us through. Eaze was a blessing. He is one of the most knowledgeable guides I have ever had in any trip and will stop in any spot I wanted to stop for either a photo opportunity or because he had spotted something that I would probably would have missed along the way.The vehicle was comfortable and proved reliable throughout the 3,500 km I traveled on this trip. Most of the roads were gravel, but he drove carefully, and Namibia takes extremely good care of their dirt roads. Eaze always tried to get to lodges before sundown to avoid encountering animals on the roads. Following Danielaâs recommendation regarding an itinerary, I went south from the capital Windhoek to Sossusvlei, then the coast at Swakopmund, then South again to Walvis Bay & Sandwich Harbor, then a bit of the Skeleton Coast and into Damaraland. After that I headed to âgame countryâ in Etosha Pan, then through the Caprivi Strip and crossed the border to Botswana and into Zimbabwe to Victoria Falls National Park. The accommodations were of a much higher standard than I had expected. Travel with an open mind and make the best of the accommodations. Namibia is an extremely clean country, that included public bathrooms along the way. One of the highlights of the trip was the stay in the Elephant Camp in Victoria Falls National Park. The luxury tent has its own plunge pool and their staff was superb. It was a trip of a lifetime, thanks to the professionalism, care and dedication from staff at NTS.",25-Sep-15,Solo,Okaukuejo waterhole

It's a 20 minute drive from downtown Luderitz, and take a taxi to visit here.  Once onsite, make sure you take a guided tour.  The backstory to how the town was created was just as interesting as the town itself.  This is a complete ghost town.  Nobody lives here.  It was abandoned 70+ years ago and is being consumed by the sand.  Someone will dig it up 1000 years from now and wonder what happened.  The town was created around the discovery and then mining of diamonds.  As this company town found the diamonds to be more significant elsewhere, they completely abandoned the property and left it intact to deteriorate.  It's eerie - out in the middle of nowhere.

And for their terrific support and recommendations. I chose a private guided tour, and travelling alone was not easy, but they assured me at each step of the short process.The process of designing and booking a journey with NTS is excellent.Some highlights: You receive a link with all the details about your journey: daily itinerary, accommodation information, trip map, activities included and optional. You can change everything you want. For example, after we agreed on a tour, and when they booked my accommodations, I requested a change, and they did it in less than one day. They share an easy-to-use app with all the information you need to carry on your journey easily.When your journey begins, and you arrive at the airport, you get your surprise bag! A lovely attention from the NTS team to start the trip. The schedule for 19 days is busy, but when you start, you have no idea about the exceptional adventure you will have.Second, every day, I was excited to discover the accommodation. Even if they share with you pictures and information, when you arrive on-site, it is always a terrific surprise. They work with partners offering high-quality services. Sometimes, I told myself, is it real? Lodges located in incredible locations will all commodities. Third, activities recommendations. They are not pushing you to take activities non-included. They have suggestions, of course, and you do what you want. As I said, they work with high-quality partners; you are never disappointed.  Must have: Air Balloon in Sossusvlei, 4x4 in Walvis Bay, and Game Drive in Onguma & Onkojima.Guide:I had the privilege to travel around Namibia with the guide, Burger Jordaan. He made this journey extraordinary through his knowledge, passion, and craziness (like me). With Burger, you can talk about everything: cooking (he has secret recipes), geology, wildlife, history, legends, sports, and more. I had incredible experiences: survival training, Khowarib Canyon, Sossusleiv at Sunsetâ¦Iâm glad and grateful to have the chance to discover your fantastic country with my new friend, Burger!

Still once you are up there, the view is mesmerising! It is worth every single effort.Then you get rewarded with having a really fun going downhill, being in sand up till your knees and finishing at the Deadvlei.

MamaAyinde,"Stanford, CA",Just an excellent tour operator,"Namibia Tours and Safaris organized an excellent trip to Namibia for my family of 4 (two parents and 2 teenaged boys).  We had limited time, but were able to cover the highlights of Namibia in 8 days. We were very happy with our accommodations, and feel we really hit the jackpot with our exceptional guide, Henk. He was very knowledgeable about the places we visited, a good driver, polite, professionalâall the basics you would expect from a professional guide.  But he was so much moreso, as well as being excellent company. (We did a one-day tour in Cape Town after leaving Namibia, and we were thanking our lucky stars that we had Henk for the Namibia and the other tour guide for just a day.)  I cannot say enough about Bianca, our tour consultant. She addressed every question or concern, and I almost feel bad about the number of changes we made before getting to the final itinerary. But in the end, we were delighted by our trip.  When my husband was delayed a few days and had to join the rest of us mid-trip, Bianca helped coordinate getting him to meet with us.  When his luggage was then lost on the way to Namibia (of course), Bianca helped expedite the delivery to us before we moved on to our next stop. I cannot say enough about the excellent service we received.  I very highly recommend Namibia Tours and Safaris.",7-Aug-17,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

Actually, our children climbed Big Daddy in 35 minutes, and ran down, and had a blast. My husband and I climbed the dune that attached to Big Daddy, but indirectly. It was getting hot by the time we reached the connection point, so we declared victory after our hour or so climb, jogged down, and joined our kids at DeadVlei.  It was a wonderful experience, but you need to arrive as early as possible, because it gets hot at noon, even in winter.",7-Aug-17,Family,Dune 45

In combination with climbing up the famous dune just with sunrise (or sunset) and maybe a short visit at hidden vlei too, it's a real must-do in Namibia. In wintertime, the temperatures are pretty nice but beware of summertime. It can get really hot. So hurry up a bit so that you can leave before midday.The way to get there is a little hard (walking through sand) but it's not too bad. There are shuttle buses but you still need to walk perhaps about 1k. When you reach, you'll be rewarded by a landscape you've never seen before (so at least for me) and every single photo you take will turn into a masterpiece that impresses everybody.

Instead of a detailed written itinerary, the car had a GPS which stopped working 20 minutes after we started.

maritimeexplorer,"Nova Scotia, Canada",Namibia's Furst World Heritage Site,"I have no idea how you would find your way to Twyfelfontein on your own. There are no signs indicating that there is a major tourist attraction somewhere out there in the burning sandstone hills. It's on a road that's off a tertiary road that's off a secondary road that's a hundred kilometres or more from anything that could be called a main road. I'm just glad Gerhardus out tour guide knew where to look.I'm a sucker for UNESCO World Heritage Sites and will go a long way out of my way to visit them. At last check I think I've been to over 135 sites out of 1,092 so I've got lots more to see. However, none of the previous 135 were anywhere near as remote or as hard to get to as Twyfelfontein. It was designated as Namibia's first World Heritage Site in 2007. In case you are wondering, there's just one more in Namibia, the Namib Desert, particularly the sand dunes of Sossusvlei.Twyfelfontein was designated because it has one of the largest collection of rock engravings in Africa.The first thing to know is that Twyfelfontein means 'doubtful or occasional spring'. It is not just the presence of the rock engravings, of which there are over 2,500, but the fact that there was a source of water in an otherwise extremely arid landscape. It was the availability of water that obviously drew the San people to the area to create what is not just a collection of petroglyphs created for art's sake, but rather a teaching tool and maps of available waterholes. What is amazing to me is that there is no consensus on how old these rock engravings are. UNESCO concedes that they span a period of at least 2,000 years, but other scholars contend they could date as far back as 10,000 years.One final point to make is that what you see at Twyfelfontein are petroglyphs and not rock paintings. Both are found throughout the prehistoric record on all continents except Antarctica. The petroglyphs at Twyfelfontein were carved or probably a better term, incised by the use of hard quartz on soft sandstone. After parking the vehicle under a covered shelter there is about a 100 yard walk to the Visitor's Centre which has information about the creation of the rock engravings and their various meanings. There is also a canteen and a shaded area to sit.All visitors to Twyfelfontein must be accompanied by a guide.  The walk to the rock engravings is not long, but the actual viewing areas entail some climbing and scrambling so anyone with mobility issues would be wise to settle for remaining at the Visitor Centre with a cold drink. Several in our group choose that option.The landscape is austere to say the least, but there's no shortage of red sandstone upon which to carve.Our first stop is not at any rock engraving, but rather an abandoned homestead. Apparently eight children were raised in it by a Jewish farmer by the name of Levin who finally gave up the ghost in the 1960's because the spring was just not reliable any more.To be sure the Twyfelfontein is still there and occasionally does produce water we are told.At last we arrive at the first rock engraving and learn that is actually a teaching instrument. What at first appears to be just a bunch of random carvings is anything but. If you look closely you will see a number of various animal tracks and even a set of human footprints. Beside the track is an engraving of the animal that would make those tracks. So imagine you are a San youngster and you have come across a set of animal tracks. You would then consult in your mind what you'd learned from studying this petroglyph and decide if the animal was worth pursuing, like a zebra or maybe you should go the other way in the case of say a lion.The rock engravings contain likenesses of a great number of animal species and most are readily identifiable.Rhinos are still found in Damaraland, but they are very rare and hard to find. Given the great number of rhino engravings at Twyfelfontein they were obviously far more prevalent in the past. Along with giraffes they are probably the most common animal depicted on the petroglyphs.Remember I mentioned that some of the petroglyphs are actually maps? There is one that has been interpreted as a map showing the location of various springs in the area including designations as to whether or not they are permanent or seasonal.We are 70 kms. (40 miles) from the ocean and that is through some of the most hostile terrain on earth. So what's the last thing you would expect to see engraved at Twyfelfontein? How about a seal?  They are in fact there.Or how about a penguin? Seriously. This gives us real evidence that the San people had much wider knowledge of the areas outside their traditional territory then was once believed.Finally here is theÂ Mona Lisa of Twyfelfontein. This petroglyph not only has realistic depictions of over a dozen species, but it also has what at first take is a male lion. However, if you look at his tail you will see it ends in a human hand. This has been interpreted to be a depiction of a San shaman taking on the spirit of a lion.I know there are some, including one who sits in the White House, who would dismiss the petroglyphs of Twyfelfontein as just a bunch of stupid rock doodles, but they are much more than that. They represent a period of human development before writing was invented and a method of communication that was ingenious and effective for thousands of years. Twyfelfontein may be well off the beaten path, but it's worth the trouble to get there.",4-May-19,Couples,Desert Explores

Mark M,"Hitchin, UK",Once in a lifetime,"A superb 5000km road (used in the loosest possible terms) trip across Namibia and Botswana. Brand new Toyota Landcruiser with two tents on top. Our route was agreed between the four of us with lots of great input from Jen who was superb at answering all of our questions in advance. Windhoek, Sossuvlei, Swapokmund, Cape Cross, some of the skeleton coast, Brandberg, Spitzkoppe, 2 camps in Etosha National Park, Ngepi, Maun, Baines Baobab, Third Bridge in Okovango, Savuti in Chobe NP, and Chobe river front. We ended our tour with 3 nights in Victoria falls.Highlights were numerous: clear blue skies in Aug and Sep for 23 days solid. Amazing 4 wheel driving mainly on gravel and sand. Great vehicle and comfy matress and sleeping bags all provided. Full car and kitchen kit wonderfully demonsrated by Steph at Wheels Across Africa. Climbing the incredible Big Daddy in the Namib dessert. Dead and Hidden Vlei were stunning. Spitzkoppe campsite is a brilliant scene and adventure in itself. Etosha self safaris with sightings of all the main animals and birds close up. The campsites in Namibia were generally served by superior facilities and safety than Botswana. The Botswana campsites had few facilities and nothing separating you from wild animals such as lions and hippos, but that added to the real excitement and sense of solitude. Boat trips in the Okovango delta and an amazing open sided helicopter ride over it. Total isolation at Baines Boabab salt plains camping next to the amazing Baines Boabab trees. Incredible star scapes. Hundreds of animals and birds along the Chobe river front on self drive safari. White water rafting and body boarding on the Zambesi, incredibly dangerous with a very tricky climb down the cliff face but totally exhilerating. Ending with the stunning Devils Pool at the top of Vic falls. I could go on forever.....brilliant!! Hints and tips: definitely take a GPS machine, almost impossible to navigate with just a map. Practice your 4wd driving in sand before you get miles away from the towns. We sometimes didnt see any other people for 2 days at a time. Ask the park rangers about safety from animals when you ente in Botswana. Maybe we were just lucky or the animals just dont go for humans but there was no real protection between yourselves and very dangerous animals as far as I could see. Obviously just respect the animals and keep your distance if you see them coming ! One of us got mugged in Kasane by what appeared to be two Botswanan girls!",23-Dec-16,Friends,Onguma Bush Camp

All vailable via an App so worked off lineHelpful and supportive team in Windhoek who provide a thorough briefing about practicalities and how to get the best out of the trip. They ensure that you have access to help if needed eg how to get a new spare tyre following a puncture. Vehicle was of a good quality and coped well with the gravel roads.Lodges were iof a very high standard in beautiful locations.We found the time quoted to cover the distances on some days a slight underestimate, but it maybe that we stopped for lots of photos.Although SA Rand cash is widely accepted, when paying by FX card, can only get the bill in Namibian Dollars, so may get charged for exchanging to another currency. Worth taking a debit / credit card that doesn't charge you fees for forign expenditure We had a fantastic trip, found the Namibians to be very friendly and welcoming, with a high standard of service.

MarkfromtheIsland,"Duncan, Canada",Great site for photographers,So this place closes at like 1pm because of the wind.  You're gonna want to go relatively early.  They sell a separate pass for photographers to go at sunrise or sunset (or anytime) and if you're an avid shutterbug you may wanna do this instead.It's just an abandoned town.  There's really  nothing more to it than that.  What's exceptional is the eerie feeling  exuded as the desert swallows it up.  Walking down the hallways and seeing dunes inside the rooms where people once slept or played is a chilling experience.Photographers shooting in HDR will simply LOVE this place.  It features in a photo essay called Namaqualand by Freeman Patterson if you're interested in checking out some of the photo opportunities.Worth a visit - this was one of my favorite photo stops in Namibia.,7-Nov-17,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Set against the brilliant blue desert sky they are a thing to behold.There are campsites you can stay in and they look pretty awesome but the wind here is a force to be reckoned with so stand warned.  There is also a lodge here that we stayed at which I would not recommend.  If we came again we would do this as a day trip.The arch view is worth a trip (enter by campsite 5) but the rock paintings are pretty meh - faded and destroyed over the years.,17-Oct-17,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole
MarkfromtheIsland,"Duncan, Canada","A 3 on a global scale, a 5 on a Namibian scale equals a 4",I don't know what this cost to visit - we went with a guide to a few locations so I can't speak to its value.Basically you walk a 100m or so from the lot to the visitor center.  This is an iconic building that's worth a visit all on its own.From there you go with a guide to see the carvings.  It's a slow paced 45-60 minute walk with a bit of uphill and a bit of tricky terrain for the less than nimble.  Go early morning or later afternoon as it can get stupid hot and you're fully exposed throughout the walkThe carvings are interesting enough.  This isn't life changing stuff but it's pretty cool and there's not much else to see around the area.Worth a visit but avoid shopping at the visitor center - it's a gouge.,17-Oct-17,Couples,Desert Explores

Purely and simply amazing.  The compositional opportunities here are boundless - limited only by your imagination.It's not pretty - it's not anything that non-photographers can probably even appreciate.

martin v,montreal,A clichÃ© but worth visiting,"You've probably seen it in movies, advertisements, posters, etc, dark tree skeletons silhouetted against an unworldly orange background. It used to be a place that few would visit. Now, even if you arrive at the crack of dawn, you'll be surrounded by photographers and other tourists. Each one seeking a unique image to take home. You'll find plenty of those pictures on the web, but take that picture too and then put down the camera and drink in the scenery. With towering sand dunes on three sides, surrounding a hard white expanse studded with the few remains of once living trees, it gives meaning to both the tenacity and fragility of life. As you look around, image would it was like more than 500 years ago when there was still water in the area and those same desiccated trees were still alive.It's a long drive, from the park entrance and unless you have a 4WD vehicle, you'll have to park after 60 km, before reaching the Dead vlei. Then you either walk or take a shuttle the final distance of about 5 km. Bring plenty of water. It might be cool before sunrise but it gets pretty hot after.One advantage in staying at the lodge inside the park is that you can get an earlier start in the morning compared to those who have to wait at the park gate before it opens.

The pricing was very fair as well (what we actually learned while travelling, as we luckily only asked for offer with this agency).The only comment to the organization would be that the pricing for European & USA travelers should be preferably in EUR, or USD (and not in Namibian dollars) as are the accurate banking transfer amounts at currency fluctuations nearly impossible.

As we climbed along the path we were told about the various trees and some of the plants natural healing. When we climbed up to the rock paintings I was surprised to see that the area was quite small. I had seen many photos of the area and always thought the rock carvings were much larger.

Getting here is not something you can simply do yourself even in a HiLux or similar . I would advise a trip from a lodge or get the shuttle land cruisers from the car park. The dunes are amazing and stunning orange coloured and hard to climb but worth it when you see into the Deadvlei for the first time - the trees are centuries old and dead but have not rotted due to the arid landscape.

mawe733,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",Do not miss this,"It really feels like you're on another planet. If you stay inside the park you can get here just before sunrise (and after the actual sunrise you have about 20-30 minutes until the sun actually makes it over the dunes and reaches the pan). It's not that easy to get to, if you have a 4x4 you can drive up to the Deadvlei car park through some quite deep sand (otherwise there is a shuttle from the main care park available). If you drive through the sand make sure you keep your speed up as many people get stuck. There are number of paths - all of them lead to Deavlei :) Once at the car park it says ""follow the markers"" which is a bit of a joke as there aren't any. We were the first ones there in the morning and had no idea where to go. In the afternoon it's easy as there's lots of people and their prints, but in the morning there was nothing. My advice would be to just walk straight into the dunes from the car park by the Deadvlei sign, past the toilet huts (you'll then see the pan once you're up a bit higher), or make sure take a campus and check where you going on a map before hand (there is zero signal for Google maps). The colours in the morning are stunning, and there were very few people until about an hour later when the main gates open for those who stay outside the park. We went back for sunset which felt a lot more peaceful and there was only one other couple there.

melcalbear2000,"Portola Valley, CA",Long Trek up- Don't need to go to the top,Big Daddy is less trekked than Dune 45.  It is much taller and I think a better way to spend the day than Dune 45 because you get the combo of the dune experience and Deadvlei.  The hike is long and takes a lot of time.  The guides who drive you in can show the shorter route which skips the first dune and takes you up the second and third dunes only which is a shorter trip to the top.  The first dune however has excellent views from above of Deadvlei.  My suggestion however is to take the shortcut and hike to the top of the second dune.  You don't actually need to go to the top of the 3rd (tallest section) to get the best photos. The experience is pretty awesome of taking so long to hike up and then you float down the dune to the floor of Deadvlei.Try to get there as early as possible.  This hike takes 2-3 times longer than Dune 45 and the wind tends to whip up in the late morning/afternoon making it unpleasant. Note the hike out through Deadvlei is still on sand and takes some time- take that into account. Bring Tons of WATER,17-May-17,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole

And the owner kindly gave us a simple map so we can learn more about the buildings. You simply park your car outside the gate and start the exploration. Honestly the town is less deserted as expected. But the place is nonetheless amazing. Starting from 8, you get your car park inside the parking area. And the crowd is also coming in.

MeraLee,"Beverly Hills, CA",NAMIBIA'S SKELETON COAST FLYING SAFARI,"NAMIBIA is a country of astonishing geology.  It is the  driest country in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to the large arid Namib Desert .""Skeleton Coast"" refers to the entire Northern coastline, bordering on the Atlantic Ocean, and references the several ships which have foundered off the coast and remain rusting in the sea and on the land, as well as the bones of whales on the shore, and stories of lost explorers.  The country is strikingly beautiful, and best seen from the air, as you can easily traverse the great empty distances. ""Schoeman's Flyings Safaris"", started by Louw Schoeman, is now run by his four sons and their wives.  You stay in  three somewhat primitive camps (with excellent food and free laundry) and are flown about each day in 6 seat single engine Cessnas. Every day also includes a long walk in the countryside.  Our pilot and guide, was Andre and he was extremely knowledgable about the geology. the unique plants, and the desert adapted animal life. This trip is quite costly due to the amount of airplane touring, but well worth it!  While not a trip for first time Africa travelers, it is a marvelous experience for the adventurous! There are stunning sand dunes, and there  is a place where you can look at the ordinary sand through magnification and discover that the grains are actually tiny bits of garnets, diamonds, and other semi-precious stones.

The only lodge inside the Park gates is Sossus Dune Lodge, and hence the only way to get to Deadvlei before sunup is to stay in this, Government-run, lodge. You need to avail one of the excursions to get there before dawn: negotiating the deep sand from the end of the tarmac to the 4WD car park near Deadvlei  in the pre-dawn darkness, is not for the visitor. It is an easy 15-min walk from the 4WD car park in the cool early morning: no need to carry water; but it gets hot after sunrise quite quickly.

If you're just there to enjoy the place, then fine, but beware the tripod-carrying fraternity who don't want you in their shot! It's a hard 15-20 min trek after the 4x4 sandy road to get there, and an hour's drive from the gate, but it's still worth getting there as early as possible, especially since in midday heat, that walk is a killer. But it's extraordinary: whether you look at the details of the knarled, dried camelthorn trees, or find a scurrying beetle on the sand, or enjoy the colours and shapes of the trees against the dunes and cracked, dried, scaly calcified mud ground.

Micheljane,"Columbus, OH",Ethnic Namibia-Cultural Experience 17 days with Philip of Wild Wind Safaris,"Where to begin? Years ago the Himba people were pictured in a travel magazine and right then their lives peaked my interest. In 2014 three of us traveled to South Africa and of course, had a wonderful time. Upon returning I started to look for a way to get to Namibia since it was right next door to South Africa.I came across Philip and Wild Wind Safaris on a Safari Bookings website then, of course, had to see what was written on TA about his Safari Company. Upon emailing Philip and his rapid response our trip to Namibia was set in motion. We returned just yesterday and are still unpacking, but have to share this marvelous experience with those who count on Trip Advisor like I do to find out the tour operators who are the best of the best. We three did SO much that it would take many, many pages just to tell all so I will be a bit more brief and try to hit the highlights of the journey. First, Philip, he is witty, fun, informative, laid back, patient, knowledgeable, easy, a dear friend and so much more. He met us in Windhoek February 6, 2016 and then dropped us off February 22, 2016. Highlights include: Sossuslei and Dead Vlei, and yes, we needed to climb Big Daddy sand dune on a day that the temperature was over 100 degrees F. We then traveled on to the next highlight of the Damara tribe's Living Museum. Of course the visits to the Himbas was well worth it and we actually made two separate visits to two separate villages. Fascinating for sure. We also visited a school near the Epupa Falls which I loved since I am a retired teacher. So impressed with the students and the teachers. We stayed two nights right next to the Epupa Falls and fell asleep each night to the sound of the water coursing over the falls. Next up was Etosha National Park and the nature at its best. Philip took us for day drives and we took one night drive offered by the Park. During the night drive we saw at least 6 black rhinos and 3 male lions plus the usual assortment of the park animals. The last of the major highlights was the visit to the Bushman tribe. It was so hot (around 100 again) but the Bushman put on quite a show for us. They were very comical and fun to watch. The places we stayed, the food, the comradery, the green of the landscape (the rains had come and everything was vivid green), the desert in bloom, Philip and his stories, made for the perfect trip. It was SO wonderful that we three are planning another trip with Philip in 2017 to Zimbabwe and Botswana.",24-Feb-16,Friends,Onguma Bush Camp

Last trip was to Namibia in 2016, this time it was a 20 day trip to four countries with primary emphasis on Botswana. Zimbabwe and Zambia made up the balance of the trip with our arrival based in South Africa. WOW, there is so much that we did, saw, ate, experienced that it would take a few pages to go over it all. I will try to stick to the highlights. Of course, Philip is an amazing guide. One wonders how he manages to pull up so much information on the spot. He has a great sense of humor, a command of the road, a way with people that makes for a smooth trip. Highlights of our 20 odyssey:Mokoro on the Okavango DeltaHelicopter ride over the Okavango Delta River safari on the Chobe RiverSundown Cruise on the Zanbezi RiverWalk with the Lions in Vic FallsWalking tour of Vic Falls ZimbabweWalking tour of Vic Falls Zambia side Tons of game drives in various parksHundreds and hundreds  of Elephants:-) It was magical to see all of the animals, the deep green of an African Spring, the numerous tented safari camps, the sundowners. It was a trip that I will never forget even as my sunburned face returns to normal:-) Thank you Philip for all that you did to make this trip special even the part of us being refugees will be a story to share for years. Little did we know that the Mugabe coup would change the course of our trip but it all turned out well in the end.Happy holidays to you and yours, Philip. May 2018 be a phenomenal  year for you:-)",24-Nov-17,Friends,Onguma Bush Camp

Michelle_Guy_100,"Durban, South Africa",Loads of fun,You going to the desert to see a sand dune. Doesn't sound like much fun. Take a board with you for some sand boarding...

midwaytoheaven,"Midway, UT",Quick Drive from Walvis Bay & Swakopmund. WORTH SEEING,"This was our second visit to ""Dune 7"" and we loved seeing it again. Always fun watching others climb but this huge sand dune either from the side or for those brave enough to try going straight up. Be sure to bring plenty of water when visiting on a warm to hot day. The sand textures are fun to photograph.BOTTOM LINE: Easy drive from Walvis Bay and only a little further from Swakopmund. There is more to do here for the adventuresome. Your can tour the dunes on quad runners. Tours go for 30 min to 2 hours depending on the tour. We got here early at the dune before the tour buses all showed up. Worth while seeing and / experiencing Dune 7. MY RATING: 8/10.No one seems to know how Dune 7 got its name. Some speculate because it is about 7 km to town and others say that from the air it looks like a number ""7"", but everyone loves Dune 7.",8-Apr-19,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole
midwaytoheaven,"Midway, UT",Interesting More Modern Era Ghost Town,"As far as old ghost towns go, the Kolmanskop Ghost Town has only been abandoned for about 60 years old when the diamond mining stopped here in 1956. Some of the old buildings are falling apart whereas some are still in pretty good shape for their age. The towns heyday was in the 1920âs. Be prepared to walk thru a lot of sand and getting sand in your shoes as you walk thru the various old homes. It is located only about 10km, 15-20 min taxi drive from town.BOTTOM LINE: Well worth the visit to see a small glimpse of this old town. Some of the old stores are still here as well as the old bowling alley. There is a small gift shop here for souvenirs. Be careful when wondering thru the old buildings since sand has made walking in the homes somewhat difficult. This is not a mobility friendly site for those with walking problems. We did not observe or see any GHOSTS on our visit. Maybe you will be more lucky! MY RATING: 7/10.Not mch is put back into this old town. The desert sand seems to keep reclaiming the old city since it closed. Plan to stay for an hour or two to see and visit all the structures.",8-Apr-19,Couples,Dune 45

When we arrived we were met by a guide and was given a 45 minute guided tour, after which we were free to walk around on our own.  There were quite a few cars that turned up obviously independently travelling.  The town is deserted but the buildings are still there and some in very good condition.  Remarkable how the diamond money resulted in this town coming into being and the very modern facilities, at least then, that they had, inclining the first x-ray station in the southern hemisphere.There are toilets, a cafe serving snacks and lunch as well as a souvenir shop.Well worth the visit, very interesting.",5-Apr-17,Couples,Waterberg National Park

Mike d,TÃ¼rkiye,Fascinating place,Visited Deadvlei as part of a Kiboko tour. Its such a fascinating and amazing place to visit. A spectacular place to take some photos and learn how the environment changes over time. We were lucky to have this as part of a tour across four countries. The parking area for busses is a fair distance from Deadvlei and the only way to get there was by safari shuttle (N$50) or walk 5km. We were lucky to have a tour guide (Micheck from Kiboko tours) who guided us on the walk across the sand dunes which was just as interesting as Deadvlei. There were many animals (mainly Kudu) on the way and surprising to see the animal tracks all across the arid and steep dunes. Its amazing to see the dead trees scattered across the salt pan some hundreds of years old. I think this is a must see attraction if you are going to see Namibia.,12-Oct-15,Couples,Spitzkoppe
Mike H,"East Patchogue, NY",self drive highlights of Namibia tour,Just back from a two week self drive tour of Namibia organized by Daniela of Namibia Tours and Safaris. It was an outstanding experience. It is an amazing country with breath taking scenery. The tour went off like clockwork. We originally planned to go in November but had to cancel literally at the last minute. We emailed Daniela that  we were canceling and would like to come instead in Feb. She seamlessly rebooked everything within  24 hrs-excellent and very professional service. The tour she put together gave us a taste of the many things Namibia has to offer and we had a wonderful experience. I have no hesitation in recommending them.,23-Feb-15,Family,Namib-Naukluft National Park
Mike K,"Sarnia, Canada",One stop shop for a variety of Namibian arts and crafts,"There are lots of nice arts and crafts found at this market centre. The's a combination of local art is made in Namibia (typically with information provided on who made it) and some of that dime-a-dozen touristy knick-nacks. Prices for local Namibian art is higher than if you were to by off the artists themselves since you are buying from a third party basically at the centre. But prices for basic knick-nacks are cheaper here. All in all, I thought it was worth the stop because even though we traveled all over Namibia for a month, we couldn't possibly have known where/had the time to stop to see the local artisans themselves. This is a one-stop shop, great before you jet back home. I'd also like to add that people were not pushy. We were not hassled like at other markets around the world. Also, there are ""security"" that watch your vehicle. I doubt they are legit but I suppose it's up to you if you want to tip and how much.",31-Mar-15,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole

Mike R,"Macclesfield, UK",A fascinating historical site,"Kolmanskop was built into a small town very rapidly at the start of the 20th century on the wealth of diamonds. The town had a bakery, butchers, ice making plant, hospital and concert hall plus many other fine buildings. There is a short and informative tour at regular intervals but it is also great to wander in and out of the abandoned buildings on your own. The desert is reclaiming the town and there are sand dunes inside many of the rooms. We were impressed by the standards enjoyed by the inhabitants over 100 years ago - all the buildings had electricity. See the mine managers home with its large granite bath still in âas newâ condition. Well worth a visit but go in the morning when itâs often misty and cool.",17-Oct-18,Couples,Etosha_Pan

Milan,"Milan, Italy",Would definitely recommend to go,"A great experience and must see if you are near by. The fund contributes to the conservation and re location of Cheetah. I've read some reviews from people complaining about the Cheetah being kept in captivity,  which is partially true. However,  the Cheetah they keep in their enclosure are the Cheetah that cannot be relocated in their habitat because of age or circumstances they were found on. If the Cheetah didn't spend at least 8 months with their mother they have no chance of survival in the wild.Was great to see the Cheetah running and feeding, the ways they educate the community to live in harmony with the surrounding predators and the research they do.Prices are not low, but also not impossible to pay. We paid around 140 euro to see the Cheetah runs and the Cheetah viewing ride (2 people).This is to be seen as a 1 time donation to the fund",9-Dec-23,Couples,Namib-Naukluft National Park

We paid our fee to get in and were treated to an excellent lecture from William (a local resident & guide) who encouraged us to delve further into each building. Most of the visitors left shortly after the tour was over which left the place to me and my husband to explore at leisure. What a blast! The town is being consumed by the sand dunes. This place looks so much like Saudi Arabia (duh, they're both deserts!) and visiting Kolmanskop reminded me of what Dhahran used to look like in the 1940's, too. I digress.So far, this has been one of the highlights of our Namibian adventure.",1-Sep-15,Couples,Dune 45
Mindenhof,"Reading, UK",Amazing vista combining tall sand dunes and a huge salt flat,A must see if you are in the area.  We started by climbing up one of the tall dunes that surround the salt pan.  The view from the top of the dunes is excellent however its a relatively tough slog up to the top.  The decent down into the pan however is loads of fun as you can run straight down a 300 ft dune to the bottom without too much trouble.  The pan itself is so strange with dead accia trees forming a weird looking forest at the bottom.Well worth the trip but do take a tour from a lodge or ensure you have a good 4WD drive vehicle and experienced off road driver if you want to get to the bottom of the dune yourself.  There is transport laid on by the park if you don't do either of these but I can fully recommend the guides from the Sousselvei lodge as they not only brought the dunes to life with their history but also put on a good breakfast after the visit,30-Sep-14,Friends,Spitzkoppe

Bring plenty of water as it is very dry and hot here by mid-morning heading into noon.  We had the added bonus of flying over the dunes en route to our next destination.

Modoc_Pal,"Vanersborg, Sweden",Excellent service and arrangement that made our trip fantastic!,"We always got a very quick and efficient response from our tour consultant Bianca Gellert.From the very beginning we had a brief travel plan and Bianca amended our itinerary with many good suggestions to finalize our 22 day Cape Town and self-drive in Namibia and safari in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. Our trip described in a short form itinerary with listing of map of the travel route, description of accommodations, suggestion of activities, important travel tips was sent to us long time in advance.   The very good travel arrangement by Namibia Tours & Safaris also included efficient and highly reliable transfers to and from the airports. Upon delivery of the rental car in Windhoek, Namibia there was a very much appreciated meet & greet session with a representative from Namibia Tours & Safaris. We then got a printed booklet, of our itinerary, with a further detailed description of our entire trip. This booklet included additional information about driving and border crossing, detailed information about the accommodations, nature and animals along the route, contact numbers to the lodges as well as numbers to reach Namibia Tours & Safaris 24/7. In addition we also got travel maps, a CD with great Namibian music, occasion for our questions about the trip and the representative gave us guidelines for safe driving.

The tour to see the stone images is a semi-strenuous hike up and down the rocks, which was a bit of a challenge for my mobility impaired wife. Luckily we did it the first thing in the morning before it got too hot. Our female guide was very good and managed to put the engravings in a cultural-historical context easily comprehensible for us that didn't know the Namibian distant past too well. Being originally from Scandinavia, it was very interesting to mentally compare these pieces with stone age and bronze age rock engravings from ""back home"".",8-Jan-17,Family,Dune 7

Within 14 days we saw very interesting places like dunes, Namib desert, Etosha park, local villages. All recommended lodges (except first B&B in Windhoek) was fine with a good atmosphere. The food in lodge in Maun (Botswana) and in Rainbow Hotel in Victoria Falls was not acceptable - accommodation OK. We recommend to spend min 3 full days in Etosha park (Namibia) and Moremi park (Botswana), where you can observe a lot of wild animals. Moreover we suggest to rent locally small plane or helicopter for better explorer. There is nothing to do in Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe), so 2 days is enough to see falls, take a river cruise, rent helicopter to see falls from the sky and visit Bomi restaurant with local dishes and dance.Wild Wind Safaris prepare everything and include almost all in the price (except drinks and lunches, local extraordinary excursions, like plane or helicopter).

Much better than we would expect at a mid level point, and the lodgings that were at the mid level were absolutely fine, comfortable, clean and secure.The itinerary was excellent with good pacing.  Expect long drives with any tour company-Namibia is spread out but we felt it was well planned with thoughtfully planned breaks along the way.Phillip, the owner, was extremely helpful and willing to let us customize as much as possible.  He helped me pick lodging at the end of the tour and helped me decide about options to stay in Etosha.  We got helpful materia. And he was completely available with good advice.Our guide was amazing at spotting animals and he was a very good driver, really working to minimize bouncing around on the gravel roads.

Morton J,"Chesterfield, United Kingdom",A Great Set of Experiences,"Well planned tour, excellent guide, lodges generally OK, but one or two not quite up to it.Two were not good - one had poor food and an awful packed breakfast, the other was very average foodwise, but poor with long distance accommodation, unsuitable for the older or less able person. Our grading would range from 1 star to 5 star. Some able persons found difficulty with the haul up to their chalets at Etosha Safari Camp. We refused to accept our allotted chalet and were subsequently placed in a family chalet nearer the central area. Swakopmund Hotel excellent. A great variety of animals, birds and plants encounteredDefinitely a tour for reasonably fit (and younger?) persons. Some activities out of our reach. An optional desert tour at Swakopmund was first class.Information given prior to our journey was very minimal compared to others with us. For example the others had details of the lodges and hotel - addresses, phone and fax details. This would have been of great benefit to us for family information prior to travel. Some lodges have email facilities, others don't. This info would again help in our planning, and was available to those booking with TUI and possibly other agencies. Also people were able to join and leave the tour at differing venues - no details of this were made available to us, although the booking made was suitable in this instance. Trailfinders is certainly lacking in the information which they either possess or give out to potential travellers on this particular venue.We would definitely recommend this tour as it was well organised, literally covered a lot of ground,  and gave a good overview of Namibia. Better information from Trailfinders should be seen as a must. It is tiring - especially perhaps for the older traveller - and if part of a two centre vacation, care should be given in advising which one goes first.",14-Jun-24,,Onguma Bush Camp

Lots of driving but we knew that and overall it was great. It was safe with friendly people and I would recommend this type of trip for independent and adventurous people. You need to be able to change a tire although we did not have to. We used this tour company and our overall experience was good. What they did was to book hotels/lodges/camps along a standard itinerary. They also gave us a rental car with a GPS. We felt that where they could have been better was in providing more trip advice, such as alternate trip ideas, info on topics like malaria, currency (use SA rand everywhere if possible) and accommodation options. They also slipped up on some details. For example, the GPS was not programmed for all of our lodges although the person who gave us our car said it was. Our consultant also only wanted to communicate by email whereas a personal telephone conversation was requested and would have been helpful in fleshing out our trip. She answered email questions but did not offer up anything on her own. We also were not crazy about the vehicle. It was a small club cab (4 door) Nissan pick-up truck with a camper shell on the back. We found that the back got so full of dust that it was not usable and all of our stuff ended up in the back seat. Although this style of vehicle is everywhere, I would prefer a fully enclosed vehicle. Overall I would consider their service quality to be average.

She was prompt with her replies and attentive in listening to our needs and desires. She strongly suggested that we go on the 4x4 Sandwich Harbor tour even though we were not keen on 4x4 trips. She was right - the tour was the highlight of our trip . She suggested that we stayed at the more affordable Okonjima Plains Camp (instead of the more luxurious Okonjima Bush Camp) and used the saving to stay at Onguma The Fort. Again, her recommendation was spot on. Everything ran according to plans; Bianca even managed to order perfect weather for our entire stay :-) We also loved spending time with Augustine, our wonderful driver/guide.

With so many people coming in and out, walking around the place is filled with footprints, which distracts from any photo you are trying to capture. The aim in these photos is to show a town desert, left to rot and ruin, to die and be recaptured by nature but this is hard to achieve when footprints clearly show the passing of peopl on a regular and constant basis. I als found other tourist inconsideration frustrating as they would see you lining up a photo, simply move into your frame and take thier shot, wrecking yours and leaving very clear footprints behind. On the plus side, if you get there early enough and the wind has been blowing for the last few days you will outside landscapes that tell a story of decay and loneliness, the footprints will be blown away and the place will look isolated and alone. Ghostly. We had some fun of our own, by slowing down our shutterspeed on our cameras and walking at just the right pace, we created ghosts of our own is some of the buildings.

In general terms there has been a phenomenal increase in the number of visitors and it has become more difficult to find solitude in this vast area. There are lots of sand dunes but very few are climbed and this is because of the accessibility of dunes. Dune 45 and Big Daddy are very accessible so get climbed.

Nicole D,"Los Angeles, CA",Unbelievable Sight!,"Deadvlei is about a 60km drive from the entrance of the park to the parking lot area. If you are looking to go when there are less tourists and crowds, I'd recommend getting there at opening time, which is 7am. Then, don't stop at any of the dunes along the way, go straight to Deadvlei and do the dunes on the way out. All of the large tour groups stop at the dunes along the way... so you can avoid them if that's something you are looking to do.The sand road from the parking lot to Deadvlei, is super difficult to drive in. We opted for paying (a super reasonable price) to get driven there in a jeep and then dropped off. From there, it's about a 15 min walk to the trees. When we arrived there was barely ANYBODY at Deadvlei, we were there for about an hour with only a handful of people... before the large tour groups showed up.

Lovely view from up there - you have to do it!!! Sossusvlei provides picnic places where you can have a nice breakfast, and if you lucky the friendly desert mice will come and visit you and beg for food!!

Nigel M,"Blockley, null, United Kingdom",Disappointment in Damaraland,"Unless a visit to the Ab-a-Huab River Valley is an absolute must, I would give the Twfelfonte Country Lodge near Khorixas  a miss.

A very large open - plan central area built on two storeys with open sides, and a cantilevered thatched roof is complimented by thatched chalet accommodation which sympathetically merges into the surrounding hillside. The central building is cleverly positioned above the huge rocks which contain the famous Bushmen stone engravings of animals and symbols carved some two thousand years ago.However an indifferent staff means that this is not the "" Out of Africa "" experience  that you might be anticipating. In the evening a lacklustre buffet dinner and staff who seem to want their guests in bed by 9pm is under- whelming.

North Carolina,North Carolina,Wonderful staff and experience--I visited 2x in 2 days,"Clean, organized, informative, very impressive and very important work. Please consider supporting their work and having a great time!I did a few activities here as I came in from Swakopmund for a noon arrival one day, then stayed the night in Otjiwarongo and came back for the 8AM cheetah run. I did the tour/cheetah feed, the cheetah drive, and the cheetah run in total.Certainly well worth a visit either as a stopover on the way to Etosha or as I did it, an extended stopover!I was curious about the two ""poor"" reviews and read them...it seems these people didn't really pay attention as their concerns were specifically addressed on the tour. They explained why cheetahs are fed from bowls: in the wild, they are picky about their meat getting dirty, so they eat out of the side of their prey, using it like a bowl. Plus, these guys are not going back into the wild.This same reviewer was ""misled"" by a video showing a guest interacting with a cheetah and was upset to not have the same experience. To get this interaction one must book in advance for the ""cheetah exclusive"" package which is a full day experience that allows you to interact with an ambassador cheetah. It seems like this person did not do much research and is not too concerned with the actual purpose of CCF's existence, which is conservation and education, not to be a petting zoo.",6-Oct-16,Couples,Namib Desert
North Vancouver,"North Vancouver, Canada",Educational and respectful,"We arrived without a reservation and only had to wait for 30 minutes before the next tour. We got into an open Jeep and were taken to the enclosure where the 4 resident cheetahs live. Theyâre old now so canât be reintroduced to the wild. We were fortunate in that we were there for feeding time, so we watched as huge chunks of donkey and horse meat were tossed over the fence into the enclosure where we were with the cheetahs. Once they each retrieved their piece, they carried it off to a spot in the shade where they could devour it at their leisure. We learned about the CFFâs conservation efforts and I have a lot of respect for what theyâre doing. There is a very good museum-type room full of information about cheetahs and other animals in the area. We had lunch there afterwards, which features goatâs cheese made from their goats. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and applaud the CCF for their efforts at saving these beautiful animals.",16-Sep-19,Couples,Desert Explores

Most of them are in other enclosures on the farm, though.Elandsvreugde Farm is NOT a guest farm where you can pet wild cats! It's strictly conservation.You can work as a volunteer and help with everything that keeps the cheetah issue going - including feeding the cheetahs living on the farm. Housing and dining is very basic.Since CCF is a non profit organisation which relies on worldwide funding you actually have to pay to work and stay there - but it's all for the cheetahs and their survival on this planet.Visit their interesting homepage to find out more.It's worth it.",6-Jun-06,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

nzTrina,"Auckland, New Zealand",The beauty is in what you can't see - the incredible feeling of the area.,"I actually don't know how to start this review. I was awestruck standing in the same places that people lived and worked and drew 2000-6000 years ago. I was grateful for an excellent guide that not only knew his stuff but was interested in us too. And, the landscape is stunning! It is one of those ""attractions"" that has it all. But can I place a caveat on my review.... If you do not find history, landscapes or walking interesting, this may not be the place for you. Twyfelfontein is one of those places that makes you realize how small you are. How big the world is and how old too. The drawings are primitive (of course) but also realistic and had stories behind them. It was interesting to learn the reasons that each one may have been drawn.You have two choices at the beginning of the walk. A longer on which does some climbing (and has two extra drawings) and a shorter 45 min one which is more straight forward. I believe you see all drawings either way, but choose whether you wish to do some climbing. You would get great views! I have seen many comments about the time to visit. Many saying avoid the middle of the day due to heat. I think this only applies in summer. In July late morning/noon was fine. Yes you need a hat and water. But it isn't overwhelming. Check the temp the night before and see whether it will suit you.I think the guide you are given will make a huge difference to your experience. We had Selverus. A young man who was soooooo informative, interesting and chatty. He was absolutely amazing and on the way back he even took us to see the spring and chatted to the kids about favourite movies. When going into the park we saw some guides walking ahead of their group not saying a thing. I am grateful to have such an enthusiastic and interesting and interested guide!!!! If you can, ask for Selverus. Even if doing the shorter walk, I recommend walking shoes rather than sandals. At points you clamber over rocks and some have slippery sand on them so having good shoes helps keep your footing sure. Speaking of clambering. I think most ages and Levels of fitness could do this walk dependent on the heat of the day and taking it slowly. You can buy drinks and craft as you leave/enter.At the same place are toilets. They are long drops, so do smell, but this is the reality of being in the middle of nowhere. But the most important thing of all in my opinion is to really try and picture what you can't see. David and his family living there in the 1960's. People thousands of years before this. Imagine this as you walk around and take in the enormity of these drawings lasting so long and you can not be disappointed.",30-Jul-16,Family,Namutoni
Oakton,"Oakton, VA",A Wonderful Place to Stay and Visit,"My wife and I spent two weeks visiting Namibia, including Sossusvlei and the Namib- Naukluft dunes, Swakopmund, Damaraland, Windhoek, and Etosha, and as a retired wildlife biologist I have to say that our two days/one night stay at the Cheetah Conservation Fund was the highlight of the trip for me.  While they do provide care for some injured/orphaned cheetahs, this is a primarily a research facility rather than a rehabilitation facility.  It is a little off the beaten path (probably a 3-4 hour drive from Etosha or Windhoek) so I would highly recommend that you plan to spend 1-2 nights.  You will definitely get the chance to see captive cheetahs up-close, but what makes this place special is how they emphasize research and working with private landowners to further conservation of this critically endangered species.  A big part of their work is breeding dogs that are used by farmers to protect their livestock from predatory cats and you can learn a lot about that program by spending a little extra time at the center.  They have newly completed lodging with a stunning view of the Waterburg Plateau, comfortable rooms, the staff was very friendly and the food was excellent.  As part of our overnight stay we got a complete tour of the conservation center and we were allowed to participate in daily care (feeding and exercising) of the captive cheetahs.  But the highlight of spending a couple of days is that you get to do a sundowner game drive on their private nature reserve and we were joined by the Center's founder-- Dr. Marker (can't promise that everyone gets as much of her time as we did).  You can expect to see gemsbok, kudu, springbok, steenbok, red hartebeest, warthogs, giraffes, and lots of birds.  If you are really lucky, you might see something unusual too like an aardvark or an aardwolf (our first sightings of either species after more than 15 African safaris).  There are wild cheetah and leopard on the property but you are unlikely to encounter them.  Please take the time to go a little out of your way and visit the Cheetah Conservation Fund.",5-Jul-17,Friends,Dune 45
OceanWanderer,"Brisbane, Australia",A Trip Back in time,Kolmanskop brings back evocative memories of life in a desert mining town as the sand reclaims what were once palatial houses and extensive buildings. This was no shanty town - buildings were built to last and built to a high standard such as the enormous hospital which had the first X-ray machine in the southern hemisphere (probably more to detect diamond smuggling than broken bones!)

Octavian Cornea,"Zurich, Switzerland",Excellent bespoke-service agency. Highly recommended.,"Let's cut the suspense and straight out the bat say this was the vacation of our dreams.In the process of booking our honeymoon we interviewed several travel agencies and tour operators and got a lot of offers. We chose Namibia Tours & Safaris because they gave us the feeling they knew very well the territory, lodges and suppliers and especially because they listened to our needs and provided a bespoke itinerary. Wilmari was our main point of contact and vacation organizer. Putting together an itinerary with heris effortless, as well as the payment of the service. She was flexible, proactive and knowledgeable. Wehad a 19-day bespoke itinerary, highlighting stays in beautiful lodges and experiences across Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. We spent most of our vacation in Namibia and absolutely fell in love with this country, its people, landscapes and wildlife. Sossusvlei, Sesriem, Damaraland, Etosha were places we highly recommend and that you shouldn't miss if you travel to Namibia.The agency also rented a jeep to us, with Wayne and Simone making sure we always travelled in safety and comfort. Namibia was amazing, all the lodges and activities we had were high-touch experiences. Hoodia was a standout experience, Thomas and our guide Daniel were extremely welcoming and authentic, they made us feel like home and pampered us. Camp Kipwe, Onguma and Ongava were absolutely amazing. Onguma was probably the most luxurious accommodation while Hoodia, the most authentic. Driving to and from lodges we used the material they sent us for directions & information and found it to be very useful, we're keeping it as a memento. The Namibia Tours and Safaris team were responsive, helpful and available which made us feel carefree along our adventure.

They have a great combination of cheetah conservation and livestock dog breeding that compliment each other. They also sell goat milk products.

Oxford,"Oxford, OH",Educational Experience,"While the site does require a detour off the main road at Otjiwarongo, the Cheetah Conservation Fund operation does provide an interesting stop along the road from Windhoek to Etosha NP, particularly since there really isnât much in this part of the country.  As part of a G Adventure group, our two hour plus stop included a tour of the research facilities, the holding areas for cheetahs and the Anatolian Shepard dogs, and a brief drive though a large compound housing several cheetahs that could not be reintroduced into the wild.  The commentary was informative and the facilities impressive, and when combined with the opportunity to observe the cheetahs and the dogs, it was a very worthwhile experience that everyone in the group greatly enjoyed.  We were also served an excellent lunch.Having read an earlier post that did not reflect our experience, I would like to add that we were never under the impression that CCF was a safari venue, but rather a research/conservation station.  Nor was anyone ever in the position to take selfies with the animals, unless they were in the distance.  The staff was emphatic about how to observe the animals, and that included not even touching the cute Anatolian pups.  The dogs are being raised to warn/protect goats from attacks by cheetahs and other predators in an effort to stop herders from summarily killing cheetahs.  Excellent opportunity to learn about preserving cheetah populations in Southern Africa, and we were happy to see our local zoo (Cincinnati) worked with CCF.",28-Aug-19,Friends,Desert Explores

ozallan,"Sydney, Australia",Comprehensive Namibia,"I recently completed the classic 12 day trip around Namibia with Sense of Africa. It was generally a very good tour in a mini van. For the southern section there were just 5 of us and for the northern part there were just 2 of us so it was fairly comfortable in the mini van. I had preferred the superior version, with better accommodation and all meals, but there were not enough guests for it to run. The accommodation however on the classic version was pretty good. And before I left my home country I had prepaid for my dinners as most locations are isolated & there is nowhere else to eat other than the hotels. It should be noted that there is a lot of driving, averaging around 400kms a day. But the scenery is beautiful and ever changing & there are always stops on the way. There are quite a few early starts. I do however have two gripes. The first is the total lack of information when arriving in Windhoek. I was picked up by a representative at the airport who did not introduce himself and knew nothing about my pickups the next day. It would be helpful if the driver had some documents for the arriving person with pick up times. I did email the Sense of Africa office & they were quick to respond with the necessary information.My other gripe was the added on 2 night stopover at the end of the tour which I had selected. It was at the Elegant Farmstead, about one & a half hour drive north of Windhoek, & it was not that elegant & a bit of a waste of time & money. Accommodation was very average & there is not much to see & do there. However the food at the Farmstead is outstanding. There is a bit of wildlife on the property but not much & nothing exotic to see. Better options would be to spend a couple of days at one of Namibiaâs better game parks or head straight to Windhoek.I had two very good guides on this tour, Reggie, an very experienced guide who knows Namibia really well & can really talk & talk & talk!!! And the trainee guide, Page, who took a few days to warm up & turning out to be delightful with a great sense of humour.

Also had a glimpse of the Anatolian mountain dog puppies which are bred there to give to the farmers to guard their livestock, thereby reducing the need to kill cheetahs. It was very hot, so the puppies were reluctant to come out of their covered living spaces. Then we headed over for the cheetah feeding, viewed behind fencing now, due to new Namibian Government rules ( safety). The staff, provide you with plenty of information.We then did the Cheetah drive. It was good to see the cheetahs up close, but it was not what we expected. The rehabilitated  cheetahs were in a fairly small area. Felt a bit like viewing them in a very small safari park. For the time and what you saw it was expensive, but, when you know your money is going towards the Cheetah Conservation Fund, it is money well spent.We had lunch there - homemade quiche which was very nice. Had a good look around their shop and purchased some very nice polo shirts.After lunch we spent some time in their museum/information centre.

Paris,"Paris, France",Inspired...,"We stayed at the Babson house - a beautiful new house built by a couple (the Babsons) and donated as a gift to the CCF. It is simply gorgeous, a glamorous out-of-Africa feeling with all the comforts of home. It is quite expensive, but the proceeds go to the CCF, so you are also supporting a very worthwhile cause when you stay in the Babson house.The house overlooks the cage of the 4 ""boys"", 4 young cheetahs, and the Waterburg plateau in the distance. Downstairs is the lab (where you can meet some truly inspired and brilliant scientists). The house is about a couple hundred meters from the museum and other buildings. You'll be asked to join in on different activities and are bound to enjoy interesting conversations with the people who work and volunteer there. There is a lot going on!I am surprised what some have said here about the interactions with the cheetahs and how they are fed and treated. The CCF is very transparent about its objectives and goals. The CCF is not a petting zoo, the animals aren't ""on display"", and its goal isn't to treat tourists to close-encounters. They are there to educate the public on the animals and help ensure cheetahs continue to thrive in Namibia and elsewhere. It's an education and research facility.When possible, they release cheetahs back into the wild. But that is not always possible, for numerous reasons. The cats at the CCF are not fed live prey, they are fed slaughtered meat, and I trust that the vitamin supplements are a necessity (they prbably know more about cheetahs' nutitional needs than I).  I am not sure how the cats that will be released are fed - but they obviously know how to hunt or they would perish in the wild. Aside from the ""ambassador cub(s)"", none of the cats are ever caressed or petted. As our guide explained, these are wild animals, and even if they are not always aggressive, at the CCF they choose to avoid any physical contact between the animals and people, outside of necessary veterinary exams. If no physical contact is present, the cheetahs present less of a danger to humans, and in turn, are in less danger themselves.I'm not really sure if some people go to the CCF dreaming of petting cheetahs and hand feeding them... That simply isn't going to happen. But you can go for a day trip, or to stay in the amazing house for a night or two, and learn volumes about these great cats. You can also join the multitude of volunteers of all ages who go there. There are also veterinary interns, biologists, ecologists and even geneticists on the staff. What an amazing place.

The CCF also educates local children and farmers in the ways of the cheetah so the cats will be safer in the environment.

He was always on the lookout for wildlife in an area where you wouldnât expect any and we saw jackal, oryx, steenbok, a huge cricket but we didnât see ostrich or hyena which he said are there, too. He is an expert driver of the dunes and we were up and down some very steep inclines to get to the tops for amazing views of both dunes and shoreline. This was one of the best half day trips we have taken and we highly recommend it!",23-Mar-23,Solo,Namutoni
Paul N,"Brussels, Belgium",Fantastic Organisation & Coordination,"We travelled to Namibia in October 2020 having postponed twice because of COVID, it was without doubt one of the best experiences we have ever had.We spent 16 days travelling in a Toyota Fortuna 4 x 4 on a self-drive tour organised and fully booked with NTS. From the very beginning the coordination and interaction with Tessa and Wilmari was superb, even allowing for our constant needs to change dates, everything was flawless. We were even accompanied by Wilmari for our COVID test on day 7 which has since been stopped and is no longer required.Upon arrival in Windhoek we were met by Ronnie and transferred to the car hire company offices in the city where we had the itinerary explained to us, along with a GPS pre-loaded with all of the addresses we needed and a local mobile phone. In addition, the vehicles are all fitted with tracking devices so that the route can be monitored in the event of problems when out of phone coverage. The vehicle and all of the paperwork was fully sanitised, plus 2 spare tyres were also carried. Our only regret, which by no means reflects upon NTS was the lack of other tourists in Namibia as we found we were quite often the only guests at the different lodges that we stayed in and some interaction with other guests would have been nice.Namibia is a vast open country with beautiful scenery and wildlife, plus very friendly people. With a low population and few people outside of the major towns and cities it's significantly safer than Europe with regards to COVID and everywhere we stayed/visited health protocols were followed stringently.",17-Nov-20,Solo,Namutoni
Paul Pratt,"Durban, South Africa",Unforgettable,"My wife and I, with another couple, recently returned from a 12 day self-drive tour of southern Namibia. Wilmari, from Namibia Tours & Safaris, did a fantstic job organising a perfect trip which had to be rescheduled and altered on a few occasions due to changing COVID-19 regulations. Namibia is far bigger than one imagines and there are so many things to see and do but, Wilmari put together an itinerary that covered the best in the south. Heading off south from Windhoek our adventure started with 2 nights at the wonderful Kalahari Anib Lodge, near Mariental. From there we stopped off at the Fever Tree Forest and Giants Playground, on the way to the the vast Fish River Canyon.Two nights at the quite unique Canyon Lodge,  built into a granite outcrop could have easily been three. From the splendour of the Canyon with its spectacular sunrises and sunsets, we headed off via the Orange River and Rosh Pinah to Ludertiz. On the way we managed to see the wild horses, near Aus. The lovely Kiaros Cottage B&B, with it's stunning sea views proved to be a very comfortable home away from home. There is lots to see in and around Luderitz but of course a must is exploring the hidden wonders of Kolmanskop ghost town.  We drove north and inland from Luderitz to the striking beauty of Sossusvlei. The self catering Desert Camp, at Sesriem, near the gate to Sossusvlei, provided us with a well appointed and comfortable base from which to venture out into, but not necessary up the gigantic red sand dunes of Sossusvlei and the contrasting colours of Dead Vlei. A walk through the Sesriem Canyon offered some respite from the heat of the day. From Desert Camp we travelled further north through the Guab and Kuiseb passes to Walvis bay and onto Swakopmond. We naturally had to stop and refuel the 4x4 so took advantage of  stopping at Solitaire and refueled ourselves with some of the famous apfelstrudel. In Swakopmond we stayed at the wonderful self catering Mylas Cottages, a block off the beach front and within walking distance of the Mole. Unfortunately due to the pandemic the restaurants and pubs were closed and wondering around Swakopmond we could see just what we were missing out on. We could of course get really tasty take-away, did go quad biking in the dunes and each of bought a pair of vellies. So our visit to Swapokmond was certainly worthwhile. Our journey back to Windhoek took us through the Bosua pass on the C28. A wonderfully scenic road which was the usual good quality gravel, apart from the 50 or so kilometres through the pass which was rough and rocky. Our last night in Namibia was spent at the Trans-Kalahari Inn near the airport. A rather quaint establishment with friendly attentive staff that provided a warm and comfortable nights accommodation along with a really tasty dinner. Given the opportunity we will be back to Namibia in a flash and with Wilmari's assistance can expect to have another wonderful tour.",27-Jul-21,Solo,Namutoni

PaulChiangMai,Chiang Mai,Highly Recommended,"Four of us (two couples) just completed  a twenty-two day Namibia self-drive and Botswana/ Okavango fly-in trip booked with Tanya Coatzee at Namibia Tours and Safaris (NTS).  When putting together trips like this we usually solicit input on possible routings and lodges from a number of agents on the ground in countries we wish to visit.  We then finalize an itinerary and put it out to bid.  A final choice is made based on price, responsiveness, and whether the agent on the ground is working to serve our best interests or theirs.  In this case Tanya was instrumental in helping us craft an itinerary that served our interests and budget and made several excellent suggestions that we ended up incorporating into our trip.  She never failed to respond quickly to any question or idea we threw out for consideration.  The trip exceeded our hopes and expectations thanks to her attention to detail.  Additionally, NTS has their own vehicle fleet to choose from which makes piecing together a self drive in Namibia seamless.  She worked to get us the exact vehicle that we wanted and which met our needs.While I will always give several operators a chance to bid on, and make suggestions relating to any trip such as this, I will not hesitate in the future to contact NTS and Tanya Coatzee if I'm ever planning another trip to southern Africa.  I recommend you do the same.",21-May-18,Couples,Namutoni

Pedrogao Pequeno,"Pedrogao Pequeno, Portugal",A little disappointed to be honest but amazing work is being done,"I think I had to high expectations. I had booked the cheetah run and behind the scenes tours weeks if not months in advance. Unfortunately this coincided with a visit of a large group. The cheetahs were in the mood for running much on the cheetah run ( wonder if the big group put them off?). It is pricey to do this and we had got up early to arrive for 8am. My husband was so disappointed he wanted to leave. I think the price should be less as for the price you think it must be something more than it is. We had a behind the scenes tour and were on the pick up truck from which they fed the cheetahs ( they run to follow the truck) but we weren't allowed in the back ""as the truck was broken"", so I wasn't able to get the photos I hoped for. But later we were offered the chance to stand in the back for the game drive (which we loved). (??!?) The senior zoo keeper was very friendly and looked after us. We didn't hear anything really about the work the fund does with the dogs etc, but did learn a lot about the individual rescued cheetahs which was really interesting. I Ioved hearing the cheetahs mew. I  hoped to hear more about the work and think we may have missed something somehow. I should have asked more questions but I thought we would see the dogs when we got back. Maybe the staff thought we had had this talk earlier.. Anyway it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am glad we went and supported them as they do amazing work but I didn't feel it was worth the very expensive price - we paid for the cheetah run, the behind the scenes tour and the lunch (which oddly we had to prebook but then we just chose and paid as per the menu). I considered it a donation .",12-Oct-17,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp

We should have stopped there, we kept driving as we in a 4x4 but then found the sandy track very demanding & eventually got stuck, along with 2 other vehicles, almost all at about halfway to the Deadvlei pan area. They should have closed the 4x4 road! Anyway, with help from the shuttle team, we all got out of the sand eventually. This was adventure in itself - the Deadvlei is hauntingly beautiful & even during our relatively short time there, the colours of the sand dunes were shifting & changing -- that hugely expansive, silent quality of the area is truly amazing. Of note, it is quite hard work to climb all the way to the top of any of the dunes that you now allowed on (some are closed off periodically).",4-Mar-20,Business,Epupa Falls

Philip_Bolster,"Groningen, The Netherlands",Amazing desert,For me Deadvlei was not that overwhelming as the dunes like Big Daddy. The pictures I had seen resulted in the fact that my expectations was very high. Nevertheless it was an amazing outing.,25-Sep-16,Family,Desert Explores
Philipp1906,"Salzburg, Austria","Great scenery, fun and a litte adventure","We've been to Deadvlei with our rented 4x4. First tipp is to stay at the camp beyond the entrance gate if you want to go there on your own because it is the only way to be there for sunrise. However, if you go there on your own you should be aware of the fact that you really driving into the desert. Getting there in the morning when the sand is still cold wasn't a problem at all. The way back on the other hand was rather difficult. Even if the track is quite busy it isn't funny to stuck there (as we did). With the help of a friendly local we were able to get out again. However there were also other cars which stuck and which were already abandoned as it wasn't possible anymore for them to get out. So do deflate your tires and calculate some extra time for the case of getting stuck. BUT absolutely do visit this magnificent place. It was one of our highlights. I guess every camp there offers a guided tour. So if you are unsure if you should go there own your own than do it with a guided tour but absolutely go there! Go first do deadvlei, the sunrise there is magnificent. After the sunrise you should go up the dune. The view up there is amazing and you can run down to deadvlei again after you reached the peak. Running down was really funny.",7-Jun-15,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole
Philipp1906,"Salzburg, Austria",Just amazing,"I already saw a lot of pictures of Kolmanskop before we went there. I expected a museum but what you get there is a big playground. If you are a photographer you can't miss this place. Why I say that it is a big playground and not a museum? Because I expected buildings filled with sand but lots of roped-off places. Wrong! You can enter the buildings in different ways and will get therefore many, many different scenes. However, what is an advantage on the one hand is an disadvantage on the other hand. Why? Because children and other reckless people start to went up all the dunes in the different buildings and cover the with footprints by doing so. Nevertheless a must-see! Absolutely go for the photographers-pass. You can be there the whole day and you will need the time. If you want you can with the photographers-pass also join one of the guided tours before noon. At 1 pm the regular visitors have to leave the town and then you have it for your own! Absolutely worth the money!",8-Jun-15,Friends,Namutoni
Philippad,cape town,worth a visit but only if you are in the area anyway.,interesting to see.

Philippe V,"Brisbane, Australia",Namibia clockwise September 2017,"I have travelled in Southern Africa several times before, but never in Namibia and never doing self driving safaris.  It was an awesome experience.The landscapes of Namibia are varied and simply grandiose.  You have a sense of travelling through space.  It is totally unique.  The driving on gravel roads, while demanding with time, is exhilerating.If you have the time, I advised to pause and spend more than one night at all your stops.  It helps with recovering from the long driving and allows to better enjoy theb places you stay.  I also recommend to check with the car hiring company what extras you can get, such as a cooler box to keep your flood and drinks cold while you drive long hours.The accommodations we stayed at were all pleasant.  The highlights were the Camp Kipwe, the Etosha Safarihoek Lodge, and the Okonjima Camp.

Phillip8789,"Terrigal, Australia",Self-Drive In Namibia - Their Organisation Appreciated,"Actually, we had negotiated our month long trip in southern Africa through Safari 365. This is a Cape Town based company. Their Sydney rep. had suggested a 12 day self-drive in Namibia, and, with some reservations, we agreed. We were so glad we did.Obviously, Namibia Tours and Safaris were co-opted to supply us with local information, maps, brochures etc. once we had arrived in Windhoek. Which they did. I also presume they assisted in booking our accommodation in the country.Our route was outlined on a map, brochures detailing the more isolated Camps and their specific location, were part of the package. A very informative booklet, outlining our drive, our accommodations, what to see in different locations, was also provided.Our only initial concern was that a GPS we had requested was not supplied. This seems to have been a communication issue between the two travel companies. In the end we drove off the next morning without the GPS, but confident in the maps etc. we had been given.We had emergency contact numbers, not only for Namibia Tours and Safaris, but also for the car hire company - Desert Car Hire.Our whole 12 days was accomplished without a single problem. We didn't get lost, there were no mechanical problems with the vehicle and our accommodation at each site was exceptional. Personal safety was never an issue.Our time in Namibia was a great personal experience.The assistance provided by this tour company greatly helped in this being the case.You can experience a similar adventure - Namibia Tours and Safaris comes highly recommended by us.",17-Dec-15,Couples,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve
Phillip8789,"Terrigal, Australia",Breathtaking,"Staying at Sussus Dune Lodge gave us the advantage of being in Sussusvlei before the crowds. We climbed a dune adjacent to Dead Vlei and watched the sun rise over the dunes and change the colours of the landscape.Down the dune into Dead Vlei was fun in itself, but then to very casually walk through the area and take photo after photo as the surrounding dunes changed their perspective, due to the light, was really unbelievable. Dead trees, desert background, clay pan floor, afforded the opportunity to take some amazing shots - even some of my photos makes me look like a professional photographer!!!We had the good fortune to come across a sidewinder snake.Whilst any time to visit is better than not going there at all, before sunrise is ideal - out before the crowds arrive and the temperature (on our day there it reached 42 degrees) makes it unbearable.This is a unique part of the world - not to be missed.",20-Nov-15,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Huts are very old and not well maintained.  There was a strong sewer odor and the soap container was empty.  On the other hand, the late night animal visits to the watering hole were fantastic.

PhotogTraveler,"Washington DC, DC",Like walking through a dreamscape,"Abandoned since the 1950's, Kolmanskop has been conquered by the surrounding desert and frozen in time.I am a photographer and asked for permission to do a sunset and a sunrise at the town. Permission was granted. I were given written approval to show any guards I ran into and had the park all to myself. Most of the tourists are there mid-day starting around 10am. I got there before the sunrise and was greeted with a fog that was the perfect setting for a horror movie. The lighting was perfect and I got amazing photographs. Some of the buildings are kept up to show how it would have looked...and others are left to nature's desire. Different size houses, layouts, a hospital, a school, and other buildings give you tons of interesting places to explore. Some of the buildings are more or less clear while others are full of sand.If you are a photographer...this is a must do site in Namibia. And ask to get in early and late. The staff is extremely friendly and willing to give you access. Like I said...I was there alone...no staff, no guards, no tourists for about 3 hours at sunset and about 4 hours at sunrise.

Those trees are few hundred years old and we need to protect them. Do your selfies and show off somewhere else. Another recommended thing to do is take a helicopter tour.

Temperatures were a bit above what we expected but since the Dune excursions were done early morning this was not an issue.The dunes were all that we expected and even more. Swakopmund a quaint town gave us time to recover from the heat of Sossusvlei and Damaraland. An extra day in Damaraland would have been nice to be able to try and see the desert elephants.The changing landscapes as we travelled all around were fascinating as was the information on history and geology of the country according to our guide.Etosha with its varied landscape from west to east was also fascinating. Amazing how the animals have adapted to the harsh conditions. The water hole at Okakeujo was amazing and one could spend the whole day and night there. What was interesting is the the discipline with which the animals took turns visiting the water holes. Even the elephants did not mess up the water but most stayed at the waters edge.Okanjima with the Africat foundation was educational and the highlight of that visit was the walk upto the mother and daughter Cheetas. The 17 year old resident leopard was also a treat.The first and last days we stayed at the Etango Ranch guest farm near the Windhoek airport.

Possum_Traveller,"Melbourne, Australia",Photographic delight,If you could see this without staying at the campsite/chalet it would be a better experience.

postscript65,"Hermanus, South Africa",Race for the dead spot,Make sure you are early at the national park entrance as there is more jockeying for position than the start of a Formula 1 race. Everyone wants to see the sun rise over the dunes and the fitest actually climb Dune 45 to absorb the stark beauty. If you have your own vehicle (especially a 4x4) take your time - it's about 30 mins drive to the central vlei. There is so much to see if you look carefully. The deadvlei (dried marsh) has to be approached in a 4x4 because of the sand but there are shuttles. The experience is about as close as you can get to standing on the moon without leaving earth.,5-Feb-16,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Produsa,"Bordeaux, France",What's the rush,"We paid a small fortune ( well for us at least) to stay at the NWR lodge inside the park to get to the pan for the big sunrise. I was sceptical to begin with on the whole sunrise experience but hey if it's what she wants right. Correct for sunset, wrong for sunrise. Apart from our suite being raided by a baboon while we were doing the sunset thing (they don't seem to care what time you get back, more that you are late for dinner) I say skip dinner and head back later.  The first thing we noticed the next morning is that cars were already travelling to the pans from 04h30 in the morning - could have been official vehicles. We left at 05h15 which is almost two hours before the gates open. Bare in mind the lodge doesn't have a gate, but the campsite does. We were the first to reach Deadvlei and it was great to be on the pan just for a few minutes alone in the dawn light. But that's all it was because steadily people started to arrive and obviously manners are left in the parking lot. Especially since you spend your hard earned cash getting there before everyone else, finding your spot and setting up for the shot you want only for a bunch of  inconsiderate Italians to arrive late, noisily and set up at the last minute right in front of you and take your shot. And here is where I find things interesting . If you are a photographer then you want to be on the pan with the trees in the foreground in shadow and the dunes exposed by the early light in the back ground. This doesn't happen at sunrise it happens about 45 minutes after as it takes time for the sun to move to the bottom of the dune in line with the pan. Then obviously the sun moves across the pan and you can run around getting different shots. Personally  I'm not convinced you need to be there first thing to get this shot, but getting there early is also part of the photographers trade so go for it. But also Namibia has time changes so it makes the whole timing thing a bit confusing. Apart from the photographer thing ON the pan to get the shot from all the brochures - you could also get a view shot looking down onto the pan by climbing the dunes around it like Big Daddy - quite a challenge and not for the unfit. Also right at the end of the pan, there is a steeper route to the top of big daddy, but even if you make it 1/4 way up you can get great alternate shots and on that side of the pan there are no trees so it's also offers more of a salt pan expanse feeling to the pictures.

We mixed camping on top of a 4x4 in the middle of nowhere interspersed with some comfort; this was a great balance.Firstly, I want anyone using this company to hunt down Bianca for guidance and advice. From a rough plan, we tweaked our ideas and ended up with a perfect trip with Bianca finding every campsite and lodge/hotel that we wanted. It was a shame to not be able to thank her in person as we passed through Swakopmund but as far as the overall trip went, excellent!We do have one non-ideal from our trip and that was the car hire company that was used. We found there were so many better vehicles to hire and I really regret not paying more attention to what we were actually going to get as a vehicle and looking to see if we could have had better from another company. The vehicle we had was not one of the fleet belong to Namibia Tours and Safaris but belonging to Desert Car Hire. I would not use them again if I was to return to Namibia.We had to put the car/camping equipment issues behind us and get on with our trip.

R1chardN,"Surbiton, UK",Start early and enjoy it.,"The Dunes at Sossusvlei are one of Namibia's iconic features and sights.  If you are in Namibia you have to go but go early to avoid the hottest part of the day and to stand a chance of getting to the top.The view of Big Daddy from the ground is 'awesome' and you can clearly see the two 'humps' on the way to the top.  There is a slight decline after the first hump so if you intend to walk to the top this way its a bit like a 'double whammy'.  There is an alternative route straight to the top but the footprints suggested this was not used very much. My wife and I got to the first hump as did all the other walkers - very few people went on.  We were there at about 11 a.m. but it was already incredible hot.I went with a guide from the lodge where I stayed and linked it with a visit to Dead Vlei. We got to Big Daddy at about 10. Despite the possible early morning chill do wear a hat, sun protective clothes, comfortable shoes, protection for your eyes and sun cream.  We walked at a sensible pace and it took about an hour to reach our high point.  Take plenty of water. Sossusvlei is about 550 meters above sea level so and trek up a dune is in addition to that.  You need a reasonable level of fitness to tackle the walk.From your high point you simply run down the dune to Deadvlei below.  It's great fun and you feel as if you are running in slow motion.  Good shoes and socks are essential and you will have to empty both at the bottom. The walk from Deadvlei back to the car is only about one kilometre but be aware of the heat and the walk is through sand so do not rush.There are no 'facilities' at Deadvlei so take plenty of water and snacks or a picnic. There are trees nearby providing shade but only very basic toilet facilities.You need a 4X4 to get to the site as the final stages are across deep and churned sand. There is a car park where you can leave your car and catch transport to the site if you need to. Otherwise the walk must be another kilometre or so.I have read that the best time to be at the top of Big Daddy is at sunrise to see the shadows it casts across the dunes.  The only way to achieve this is to camp in a tent inside the National Park as it does not open until sunrise.",12-Apr-18,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

Beware of photo overload!I went with a guide from the lodge where I stayed and linked it with a visit to 'Big Daddy'.  We got to Dead Vlei between 11 and 12 - so just before the sun was at its' hottest.  Do wear a hat, sun protective clothes, comfortable shoes, protection for your eyes and sun cream.

R1chardN,"Surbiton, UK",Interesting history and not expensive.,"Built in the middle of nowhere, Kolmanskop is a good example of a town built for a specific purpose.  Once thriving on diamond mining it was built as a replica of German town to make the employees feel at home.  It is now a group of sand filled buildings that have fallen into disrepair with the exception of those that have been (or are being restored).  All building materials were originally imported including the sand for the mortar from Germany and the wood for the floor of the bowling alley fromOregon.We went on Easter Sunday when there was only one guided tour but check to see if this is always the case for a Sunday and how many tours run in the week.  The entrance fee was 180 N$ and that included the tour.  You do not have to take the tour.  On the day we were there the group was spilt into three - English speaking, German and African.  The tour lasted about 45 minutes and there were about 20 in our group.The tour helps the place come to life!  It concentrates on the main parts of the town - the concert hall, the bowling alley, the butchers, the ice factory, main shopping street and an overview of 'millionaires alley' where the senior dignitaries lived.  You will see how they made ice and distributed it so that every household had a refrigerator!  The mule pulled train to transport people to and from the shops is also there on original of track.You are free to explore the town on your own and take as long as you wished. Many keen photographers did but we opted not to - partly as we both dislike snakes and we did not want to tempt fate!  There are numerous signs on doors advising you to shut them to prevent snakes entering the buildings - our guide told us it was some months since a snake had been seen on the site.It is easy to get Kolmanskop.  It is about 10 km from Luderitz or 100km from Aus.  It is on a mainly straight tarmac road that was built specifically for the the diamond trade and (I guess) paid for by the diamond industry. We stayed in Aus specifically to go to Kolmanskop and Luderitz.It made a great day out - The drive took just over an hour through desert 'moonscape scenery', past the wild horses and alongside the new, and as yet unused, rail track which is covered by drifting sand dunes on many parts.

Rachel B,"Atlanta, GA",An absolute must see!,"The Namibian Craft Centre is a staple in Windhoek and as someone who lives in Northern Namibia, I always pay it a visit when I'm in town. The vendors are all very friendly and not at all pushy. Haggling isn't allowed (which is a relief for people like me!) and most major credit cards are accepting, though to be safe, you may want to pay in cash (make sure you have plenty of Namibian money on you). The cafe has a nice selection and is a great place to stop for lunch or just a quick snack.The centre can be a bit of a tourist trap, so if you're looking for traditional Namibian crafts, do your research before coming. Otherwise, you may find yourself going home with a rain stick - which isn't traditional at all! Also, be wary walking outside of the centre. Independence Ave doesn't usually have more than pick pockets, but the other areas may have more aggressive criminals who will target tourists.But all in all, an awesome, affordable experience and a great place to get some unique souvenirs!",30-Apr-19,Family,Swakopmund Museum

RADToronto,toronto,Namibia land tour,"Our group of 13 just returned from land tour in Namibia (June 7-22) organized by Safari 365 and Namibia Tours and Safaris.  It was an extensive tour, covering a large portion of the country and often times, the travel time between locations range from 4-7 hours but the scenery was amazing. We split the group into 2 vehicles, and had 2 drivers/guides, Frank Austin and Ronnie Buys, both excellent. Our objectives for this trip were to experience safari, including Kalahari lions, bird watching, as well as dessert scenery such as Sossusvlei and the Skeleton Coast. As such, we had a wide variety of accommodations. Wilmari, from Namibia Tours & Safaris did an amazing job with detailed itinerary, gift bag with map, Wildlife guide book and scarves as well as water bottles for our trip.Our accommodations were exceptional except for the Africa Safari Lodge. At this location, some of the rooms were dirty, ant infested and the drainage from the shower, clogged with hair. The most luxurious were Omaanda and Anderssons at Ongava (near Etosha, recently renovated during the pandemic). The most interesting architecture was Le Mirage Desert Lodge, reminiscent of Moorish castle. The friendliest staff definitely belonged to Doro Nawas (in the Abu-Huab River Valley, also the most musical group and the best Oxtail dish ever). Most spectacular waterhole at a lodge is Anderssons where we saw 5 rhinos at the same time, 3 white and 2 black. The most amazing waterhole in Etosha was Chuddop on our last day in eastern Etosha during the late afternoon game drive where we witnessed 2 large elephant herds, 30+ animals in each group, arriving to drink, surrounding our 4x4 vehicles.Overall, the food was fine. There was a lot of game meat offered at Intu Camelthorn, Kalahari Game Lodge and Africa Safari Lodge, some of it was a bit tough compared to beef. Dinner portions at Omaanda were too small. Packed lunches and breakfasts from Anderssons and Mushara Lodges were below expectations given the price of the lodgings. For example, the wraps from Anderssons were not tasty and the dry bagels from Mushara, some found inedible. Of note, I found it somewhat confusing the terms Fully Inclusive vs Full Board Plus vs Fully Board. I think it means whether or not drinks and laundry are included with the pricing. Despite postponing our trip for 3 years due to COVID and having our first travel agent, Danielle Venter, who left Safari 365, replaced by Clive Murray just a few months prior to our departure, the highly anticipated trip of a lifetime was a huge success. With the exception of minor issues such as picking up passengers from other hotels in Swakopmund on route to our private full date Catamaran Dolphin Boat Cruise with 4x4 Sandwich Harbour excursion, and a misunderstanding about additional guests on our morning safari game drive from Mushara, we had an absolute amazing trip. Due to the amount of luggage, a trailer was added to the 11 passenger vehicle and along the way, the built-in water tank leaked which made the bottom soft luggage wet but Frank and Ronnie immediately corrected the problem. Not surprisingly, the suitcases were covered with sand/dust while on route but the amazing guides made sure the luggage were dusted off before they were delivered to our cabins. While driving back to Windhoek on our last day, we had some car trouble whereby it was stuck on 4 wheel drive which meant, the alarm kept going off every few seconds when the speed limit was >60 km. Frank was able to obtain another minivan along the way to transfer the group and luggage as soon as possible. Fortunately, it didnât break down. Initially, we were given the option of doing a self-drive with the smaller 7 passenger vehicle but in retrospect, we were very relieved that we had Ronnie as our driver. Donât think the designated driver would have enjoyed the trip at all. Certainly, if you compare Namibia to Kenya or Tanzania safaris during the migration, there is no comparison at all with respect to the sheer number of animals but the scenery in Namibia is so unique that itâs hard to forget.",3-Jul-23,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole

Arriving in Windhoek, somewhat apprehensive about driving ourselves 4000km on mostly gravel roads, as well as through Etosha, we were most reassured by our meet and greet with NTS staff. They had thought of everything, even going so far as to stock the vehicle refrigerator with complimentary waters. We cannot recommend NTS and Tanya highly enough. The only way to 'do' Namibia is a self-drive safari. I'm planning our next trip already.",14-Jun-17,Friends,Namib Desert

Ramadama,"New Providence, NJ",Very interesting site,When visiting this site be sure to wear comfortable walking/ hiking shoes. The terrain to climb up to the area with the petroglyphs is very rocky. They did not make a clean path so you will have to figure out the best ways to walk on the various rocks up the hill. Once there some areas have steel sep platforms set up to view the petroglyphs. The petroglyphs are about 2000 years old and they think it was used to teach the hunters about the animals in the area. This is just a small amount of the petroglyphs in the area but gives you a good idea of what animals were in the area.

Rc1,"Folsom, CA",Excellent company!!!,"My husband and i just returned from a 19 day trip of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. We worked with Anja Fulde in planning our trip about 6 months ago. Right from the beginning she was very knowledgeable, understood exactly what we were looking for, was very responsive to our needs, prompt in answering all our questions (and believe me, I had many), and was extremely professional. To plan a self drive portion, and then a guided one, with all the transfers that it took, without a single hitch says a lot about Anja and this company! Everything worked out seamlessly. Our contact person in Windhoek, Carlo, was very helpful in giving us driving tips with maps and printed directions, etc. We had a few questions along the way and I would text Carlo and get a prompt response with the answers I needed. The lodges and hotels Anja picked were lovely, each had its own charm and attraction. They were all perfectly situated and I wish I had more time in many of them. The vehicle provided for our self drive portion was in excellent condition. We are proud to say we drove the entire way without a single flat :) They provided us with a Garmin GPS, which we ended up not using as its directions were often confusing as they didn't match with our Google Maps app nor Waze app. Since my international phone plan didn't work reliably there, we got a local SIM card at the start of the journey, and I would highly recommend that to other travelers.

No sign to tell visitors which direction to drive in, in case people want to drive their vehicle further to the actual site of the dead pan, which is about 5 km from the main parking area. There was a small portable office open but no one was inside. As we were thinking of walking on a trail marked there, which would have taken us to some place totally different, a Jeep showed up and the driver yelled out asking if we wanted a ride. I wasnât even sure who he was talking to. But then he explained the process, for a payment to the park we could get a round trip to the dead pan site. Even though we had a 4 WD, we opted to go with them driving as as these 5 km is very sandy and we saw at least 4 vehicles stuck on the way. The site itself is amazing and only a short walk once you get dropped off. We spent some time walking in the pan area admiring the views. It is also the site for the Big Daddy dune for people wanting to hike up. Again, no signs, so we missed it!",4-Jul-23,Couples,Waterberg National Park

RealMrMagoo,"Alexandria, VA",Great trip organized by our consultant,"We used Namibia Tours & Safaris in August 2014 on the recommendation of an excellent safari company we previously used in Botswana. Rather than a self-drive, we opted to have one of their guides drive us as this was our first time in Namibia. Our guide was Augustinus, who is very knowledgeable about his country and was generally very courteous and a very good driver. Our consultant was Edward Taylor, and he handled the planning of the 9 day custom-planned trip, the booking of the accommodations, etc. based on our expressed desires for places to see and things to do. Our lodging included an ocean view room in Cape Cross and a cabin that was literally the closest cabin at Etosha's Okaukuejo waterhole - both far exceeded our expectations. We were unable to get all our lodging choices as some were already booked, but the alternatives were reasonable and acceptable. Our trip included visits to the Namib-Naukluft & Etosha national parks, Africat conservancy, and Cape Cross -- as well as shorter stops in Walwis Bay, Swakopmund and the unexpected gem that is Spitzkoppe. Mr. Taylor did a great job planning and booking the trip, and Augustinus followed our itinerary and did a great job showing us some highlights of beautiful Namibia -- including some we had never heard of and would have never found on our own.

review_84,"Windsor, United Kingdom",A solid but unspectacular experience,"We did a 8 day/9 night trip around Namibia with Sense of Africa (SoA) taking in Sossusvlei, Sesriem Canyon, Swakopmund, Twyfelfontein, Etosha and Windhoek etc as part of a three week honeymoon trip in southern Africa. SoA was booked through another tour operator which organised our whole three-week trip.We had very high expectations of Namibia but unfortunately, our overall experience wasn't quite what we'd hoped. The distances travelled over the course of the trip were vast in a minibus which could've benefited from more space and better air con. We're used to travelling long distances on holiday but we didn't feel that this trip gave enough sites of genuine interest to warrant the miles per day. The scenery is stunning at times but in our opinion not varied enough to sustain so many hours of driving almost solidly for many of the eight days. Our guide was a really nice guy and great at the organisation side of things. Unfortunately though, we felt that we'd have liked to have learnt more along the way which certainly would've helped to break up the journey - for us the advantage of a guided tour around the country rather than the popular self-drive was to benefit from the passion and knowledge of someone who knows the country, not just to be a driver. The issue on our SoA trip may have been a question of language rather than knowledge. Our guide's English was basic but fine but unfortunately we were in a group of eight in total, six of whom were German (ie we were the only English speakers). Having both studied German degrees and lived in Germany (pure coincidence - the tours operators didn't know this) came in handy as the dual language tour quickly slipped into German-only as much of the party didn't speak any English. Unfortunately this didn't really benefit anyone as our guide's German was basic at best, despite his best intentions. (We spent three weeks touring Africa so experienced many English-speaking guides in four countries so feel that we have lots of good points of comparison.)Language aside, it felt very bad planning to put two Brits with three German-speaking couples, particularly without a strong bilingual guide. I think it was very fortunate that we could speak German as there was an expectation that we would all eat together as a group every night and dinner conversation was always in German. We loved the opportunity to speak German (we are German-philes!) but it seemed very poor planning of SoA to make this kind of assumption and in truth we did feel rather isolated (though being late twenties in a group of 50-somethings probably didn't help!)In terms of the group dynamic, we didn't much enjoy the perceived obligation to eat dinner together every night - after many hours sat together in a minibus each day, we looked forward to some time alone (it was our honeymoon after all and the age-gap meant we had little in common) but we felt that there was a strong expectation we'd all meet every evening, even in Swakopmund where we all had time to do whatever we wanted. Perhaps we are particularly unsociable but it would have been nice to have more freedom in the evenings.Also, one point to add was that both of the safari days in Etosha are spent in the minibus, not in a jeep/4x4. Having started our honeymoon in Botswana, we knew that an open vehicle really enhances the experience, so we paid for a full-day guided game drive for one of the Etosha days. The second day we drove to another lodge so didn't have the option but we'd definitely recommend doing this for the first day. Seeing wildlife from a stuffy minibus with poor visibility just isn't the same!Overall it was a good and relatively inexpensive way of seeing a large amount of what is a big and beautiful country. However, with hindsight, we wish we'd asked more about the group in advance and made sure we were either in a mixed or English-speaking group so that we could've had more knowledge from the guide. That way we could've come away feeling that we'd really got a sense of the country, which unfortunately, with SoA, we didn't.",13-Nov-24,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Rich S,"Montrose, CO",Wonderful adventure made possible by a great company!,A most enjoyable adventure in every way possible.  We have wanted to see Namibia and Botswana for a long time and found the services offered by Namibia Tours and Safaris to be excellent.  We had an approximate idea where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see and experience in the way of animals and landscapes and the people of these two countries.  We considered many different options of means of travel and itinerary and looked at many different tour companies offerings and suggestions.  Namibia Tours and Safaris seemed to be the one company that stood out by accommodating what we said we wanted and making suggestions on how we could see and do more of what we seemed to indicate we wanted to do.  In other words they did not just book us in to exactly what we said because we could have/would have missed things we were not aware of from our vantage point in the middle of the USA nor did they prescribe exactly where they thought we should go.  It was a back and forth booking arrangement.  We were even able to make changes by adding on additional days at different safari camps as we learned more about them.  The automobile they arranged for us for our self-drive tour was excellent.  The camps were perfect.  They handled a change we requested on our last day with no problems.

Although cheetahs may be the feature, the story is so much bigger and all the experiences you can select from are worth the trip. Not only has CCF studied the cheetah and saved countless orphaned cheetah but their conservation efforts with farmers as well as utilizing local resources for jobs to aid the economy are remarkable stories to hear. The international support is obvious as we met staff from Canada, UK, USA and Switzerland, all accommodating to our needs and enthusiastic about their mission. Our local guide Stephen was knowledgeable and an ambassador for all aspects of CCF; ask for him. You can review the educational exhibits and grounds for a low-cost day or pay for the game drives or cheetah runs and feedings. Those costs are worth the money when you consider these funds help support their research and community outreach. We selected the Cheetah Run (fascinating) and Beelebeno Cheetah Safari Drive, worthwhile even though we have been on multiple game drives before in Namibia and ZA.

The safari tour gives you access to only two areas which are rather small and only host seven female cheetahs. You will not get to see the males but will have access to a very well designed museum where information are very well gathered and delivered and where you can learn a lot about cheetahs. Overall, I was expecting a little more for the price we paid but I have to admit that I was totally in awe at what this American born lady (Laurie Marker) was able to accomplish and how diverse and clever her approach was to saving the cheetahs. It made me want to look for her and shake her hands as the facility she was able to build up from nothing is totally outstanding. Therefore I thought that, if the money we spent is used to help save the cheetah, then it was not that overpriced after all, considering the results she has achieved so far. Laurie must be a wonderful entrepreneur on top of being a real expert at Cheetahs; she introduced the Anatolian Shepards and trained them to guard the cattle and then gave them to the farmers to prevent them from shooting at cheetahs attacking the animals. This is really going to the root of the problem and solve it. She also hosts sheep that produce milk for the âdancing goatâ dairy products she sells, along with wooden pallets used to  light stoves and fireplaces, in order to self-support the Cheetah Conservation Fund.

These are all pretty tame though, as they have in the conservation center since they were cubs. The large enclosures for the wild and injured cheetahs are not for tourists, so the cheetahs won't adapt to humans.

Typical German attention to detail abounds.1,000 kilograms of fresh water were hauled from Cape Town (yes, you read that correctly) regularly for a holding tank on the property.A salt water swimming pool is perched on the top of the hill above the town.A coal-fired plant produced electricity for the town.An ice fabrication plant chilled fresh water ice blocks using a chemical - seawater technique to provision home ice chests with ice blocks.  I could go on and on here.  Go and see this place.  And make sure you get a tour guide.  The factoids about this place are amazing.  And they are a great example of how those with money in the early 1900's made sure their workers got the best money could buy for the time period.This is a great site for photos â we took hundreds.

Rowie,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",An Indescribable Desert Oasis Of Dead Trees,"Namibia is simply stunning with some places more stunning then the next!Sossusvlei is one such destination worthy of a visit or visits, as the case maybe.The scene changes as the weather and climate does - continously a mystery at different times of the day creating different magical scenes to the naked eye.It could be a day enshrouded in mystery and mist or a bright and sunny cast of shadows creating a myriad of colors and shades on the surrounding fiery sand dunes.I need not go into detail on the history of this phenoma which is goggleable, but let the pictures taken by our group do the talking.Should you plan to visit at sunrise, leave as early as possible in the morning. It is a good idea to charter your own 4x4 and driver and request to depart your lodge as early as 4.30am! Everyone else at the lodge is scheduled at 5am.The gates to the park only open at a fixed time in the morning, so it is only feasible to stay in the Sossusvlei Dune Hotel ( a slightly costlier option ) which is sittuated within the park, hence your personal driver will ensure yku leave before the schedule group departure at 5am. Request for a breakfast picnic thereafter within the park, as you will be famished.Note, those staying outside the park will only have scheduled sunrise departures at 5.30am after the guests of the Sossusvlei Dune Hotel have departed.Therefore, your choice of lodging is imperative to get you to Sossusvlei before the masses.We scheduled a two night stay here and visited the dead tree forest three times and each time was a different experience!The surrounding red and orange dunes, Big Mama, etc will wow you. Climb them if you must as it will enthrall you unlike any other.Do wear proper covered shoes and be prepared to walk for a good 20 mins at least should your driver take you up to the last car park.

Don't be afraid to explore. Walks are gradual and undulating. There is only one cafe selling some souveniers and some light food.

As you might predict everyone is coming off the dune at midday to get out of the heat. The poor park rangers actually looked frightened as hoards of europeans fought for spaces in the 10-seat jeeps. People elbowed each other, ran up the road to commandeer jeeps before they could pull into the car park and every ruse imaginable.

Most buildings are now being taken back by the sand, but the bowling alley still has the two lanes and a wooden ""bowling ball"", the casino has an interesting photographic display from the heyday of the town, and the ice factory still has some of its original equipment.

We saw lots of herds of elephants with some very young calves and even some bulls fighting, we saw hundreds of Mountain and Planes Zebras, a few giraffes, lots of Orxys, Springbok, Steinbok, Kudu and other antelopes (?). But the highlight was definitely seeing the elephants as we saw other 35 and it was magical seeing them slowly and majestically stroll over to the watering hole.

Beautiful clean landscapes, interesting wildlife and warm and welcoming people. Martha arranged the tour which included almost  everything we wanted and asked to experience in 10 days ( you can't have it allâ¦).  The program was very intensive but worth every minute. Martha  made it work out to the very last detail.  Starting from picking us at the airport, then 10 days of the trip â travelling,  walking, feeling, tasting, exploring and having a lot of fun. Every day we had a new surprise â the beautiful  luxury lodges. We were lucky to have Jonathan as a guide. Not only knowledge and practice but also his passion to make us understand the real life of the people in Namibia that made it so special.

And ending up having not enough time left to organise the honeymoon trip.  Luckily, we got in touch with Namibia Tours and Safari, after an extensive google-site. Their website offers an excellent overvew of possible trips and tours, with lots of variety in accomodation,and budget.We immediately felt at ease with all the knowledlge and local experience from the staff members. They KNOW what they are talking about. They seem to know every inch of the country :-)  We were very happy with the quick responses and detailed proposals - most of the time, same day reaction to questions-, also very enthousisatic about the  accuracy of their work, and perfectly interpreting our wishes and demands, and translating them into concrete suggestions and proposals.We highly appreciated the service and detailed information we received upon arrival. Every planned  transfer was extremely punctual, good and neat cars, buses,... rental car they arranged was top!But like I said, it is all in the details: we managed to forget our Ipad in the safe of one of our first lodges, up in the north, Caprivi area.  After a week, somebody found it, and the lodge owners contacted Nambibia Tours to find out if it belonged to us.  With only a few days in Namibia left, Chantelle, our Nambia Tours and Safaris Contact Person, succeeded in arranging a transfer of the Ipad to our final hotel in Windhoek. When we arrived at the hotel, the Ipad was waiting for us.  They didn't charge a penny for it.

And experienced guide met us at our guesthouse and went through our trip and route in great detail, which was incredibly helpful, and offered us little tips about how to change our route or make it even more comfortable. We ended up renting an automatic 4x4 (being from the States, neither of us had much experience with manual transmission), which was the right decision for us -- the road can get bumpy and you might even have to ford a shallow stream or two. We also stayed in a mix of campsites and lodging, which was the perfect combination -- most of the campsites were incredibly comfortable (bars, pools), but it was always nice to have the occasion to sleep in a real bed.

The photos others have posted and which I will post upon approval of my review tell the story of what one can see at Kolmanskop, with its eerie beauty and reminders of its working past. A key fact to keep in mind is that it is not open all day; we arrived late and thus had no guide and might even have been considered trespassers. One aspect I appreciated is that for the most part there was no debris on the grounds or buried in the sand as best I could tell that would have caused a trip or fall, unlike other abandoned places.  It's too bad in some spots people had created unnecessary footprints in the sand which detract from the scene/photographs. This is definitely worth a visit.",10-Jul-18,Friends,Dune 45

We didn't check any recommendations.And we should have..We met a totally disappointing guide , Johan , who was uncooperative at all. He didn't do his job. He was a driver!In no way a guide. We read  Lonely Planet each evening, to see what we had seen!He told us,  for example, that we couldnât do Cape Cross , no time. And on the other day that it is noisy and stinky and better not going there...On arriving to Swakopmund he left us in the middle of the day and went home..Until the next morning.Lots of other examples!The reaction  of NTS to our complaint was that if we would tell them during the tour, about Johan, they would change him immediately .We didn't even think  about a new guide in the middle of no where..We coped with him.We tried to enjoy! We think that a good company have to check well their guides.

sascot,"W Cape, South Africa",Too popular ?,"I would never deny the fact that Deadvlei, Soussuvlei, Big Mamma & Big Daddy dunes or any aspect of this breathtaking area of natural beauty is anything but a must see. We had the good fortune to visit with one of the most knowledgeable and likeable guides ever encountered at any tourist site anywhere in the world but - there always is one - management of this park is lacking. Namibia Wildlife Reserves (NWR) has to raise its game. Has the park become too popular ? No, there is the space and if you manage your visit properly you can avoid the masses. Where matters fall apart is that NWR seems to have no understanding of what the thousands of (largely international) visitors require, first on the list being toilets. Hundreds of bodies a day are pouring onto these dunes, which miraculously repair themselves within hours, sand blowing away all traces of their footprints. What does not disappear though, is the toilet paper. If you have the need to 'go', your options are a couple of disgusting long drops that sit in full view of everyone and then at the Dead Vlei car park a portacabin type structure that contained three ladies and three gents WCs, none of which had running water. Not surprisingly, people shun these meagre amenities and head off ""au naturel"".  So if you are going to visit, which you must, here are a few useful hints. The gate at Sesriem opens at 06:30. From before 06:00 the queue starts to form. Tour buses, 4X4s, cars, game vehicles. Arrive at 06:45 and they will all be on their way and you don't have to queue. Then drive without stopping the 50kms down to Soussusvlei, past all the tour groups who are stopping on the way there to take photos of the sunrise or climb dune 45 and you will be spared the hordes that eventually will arrive. But above all, go to the loo before you start your visit..............",1-Jun-14,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

SCBCumbria,"London, UK",Namibia's dramatic mountain,"The triangular red shape of Spitzkoppe mountain can be seen for miles before one reaches it. Often called the Matterhorn of Namibia because of its shape, it is a dramatic mountain that deserves a visit. Below the rising tower of the mountain is green green feathery grass and huge golden boulders many of them 100s of feet high. These huge rocks are made of a quartz conglomerate and are easy to walk up and over - we saw two climbers like ants way up on one slope that looked nearly vertical.The site is run by local Damara people who handle the booking for the camping sites around the mountain - these are spread around so should be peaceful. There is little else there so supplies need to be brought in. Definitely worth a visit.

It's a short walk to the site from the ticket hall and one is escorted by a guide. The ancient carvings themselves spring out from the rocks and are very appealing. The lion rock is the one to see - I would have liked rather longer there to linger but we had pushed it by arriving at closing time so didn't want to keep the guide. The scenery on the way to Twyfelfontein is also extra-ordinary and so colourful. A truly special place.

Serena E,"Placitas, NM",Amazing Site. Beware of NWR staff!!,"Deadvlei was amazing, but beware of NWR staff.  During our first day, we successfully drove to Deadvlei, hiked the Big Daddy dune and out to Hiddenvlei.  During our second day, we climbed Dune 45, hiked in the canyon, and visited other sites.  We had one more site to see -- Narravlei.  It's wasn't terribly important to us, but we had ~1 hour to kill before we needed to start our return towards Windhoek. When driving out to see Narravlei, our vehicle stalled in the sand.  We probably could have pushed it out in ~5 minutes, however, a NWR vehicle immediately appeared.  The driver insistent that we get in his vehicle and he show us the park.  We explained multiple times that we had already seen almost the entire park, had an extra hour and just thought we'd try to find Narravlei, but really did NOT want a ride.  However, he would not listen to us nor leave us alone (to push out our vehicle). In the end, we felt forced to /bullied into riding with him.  It was a short ride of Narravlei, he picked up others, drove back to our car, backed it out of the sand, then told us to follow him to the entrance to pay him.  He then tried to force us to pay the equivalent of ~$25.  We were at the end of our Namibia trip and had gotten rid of almost all of our Namibian/South African cash, and ended up having to pay him in US dollars.

Some younger people would not have minded it but there was no air conditioning and the beds were like sleeping on springs.  The best thing to do is stay at Otjiwarongo at Bush Pillow Lodge and drive up in the morning. The facility is well run and you can see the love and care that goes into the animals. We watched the Cheetahs run from outside.  You can be inside and watch them up close.  We chose to do the Cheetah drive which brought us up close to the cheetahs with no fences. We also saw the Anatolian Shepard dogs which are being sold to farmers to protect their livestock. This keeps cheetahs and other cats from killing off their livestock.  This is a great program which has helped the survival of the cheetah.  The farmers are not killing the cheetahs.On the property they also had a creamery where they made delicious goat cheese which can be sampled in the cafÃ© at lunch.  One of the highlights of this facility is a comprehensive museum explaining the genealogy of the cats.  It was very comprehensive and extremely informative.  The exhibit was done very well.On a personal note we got to mingle with Mike Gardiner Assistant Manager of Hospitality.  He is a definite asset to the CCF. He did the drive with us and was extremely nice.  Mike made our visit very enjoyable and is an asset to CCF. All the other employees were wonderful too but we spent most of our time with him.Every one should visit this facility.  And if you cannot, a donation would be great for the wonderful job that they are doing. Cheers to Laurie Marker the founder.",2-Nov-15,Couples,Dune 7

You will walk the site with a guide, who will take you to the carvings and will also be able to tell you a lot about the history of the people of the area. Although there are some steps and platforms to help, most of the engravings are reached by clambering over rocks so bear that in mind.

Great for photographs especially first thing in the morning when the shadows give great contrast. Be sure to take a hat, plenty of water and sunglasses to protect your eyes from the superfine sand that can get whipped up on the slightest breeze. Also recommend a neckerchief or scarf for protection from the sand if the wind picks up. This area is best reached by jumping on one of the regular-ish 4x4 transfer vehicles, as the sand is easy to get a vehicle stuck in.

I would not recommend doing the last stretch of the drive if you haven't done off-road soft sand driving before because it's not worth getting stuck. Remember to wear climbing shoes or sneakers.

Shar1ene,"Singapore, Singapore","Excellent trip, well planned and executed.","We first started planning with Wilmari of Namibia Tours and Safaris in 2014 but could not make that trip due to illness in the family. Finally this year, we managed to get ourselves there and Edward took over the finalisation of details of the trip as Wilmari was on long leave. Wilmari gave me excellent advice on the routes and planned out the itinerary and Edward fine tuned it before we were to go. Both were excellent in their response time and could give good information on things to do and see. The star of this trip is certainly our guide Augustinus. He was our guide, driver, tracker, walking encyclopedia on wildlife, photo advisor all in one. Our main aim for the trip was to take photos at Deadvlei and he got us there in time for sunrise, advised on the best position to set up the tripod, where the sun will hit first. We didn't need to do any homework with him around! He was also punctual and if we were meeting at 4.45am in the morning, he would be there at 4.30am. In between, he somehow managed to keep the 4WD spotlessly clean inside and outside, on top of driving hours each day on the gravel road. His handling of the vehicle on rough terrain is excellent. Safe and yet efficient. He even managed to help another tourist get his car out from the sand in Sossusvlei! Augustinus knows all the shortcuts and back roads like the back of his hand and took us through some spectacular terrain off the tourist grid. All necessary permits were organised and routes mapped out before the next day. He has the best eyes and can even point out short little meerkats in the bush from 75m away while driving at 90kmh! Half the time we couldn't see a thing till it was right in front of us! Everything went without a hitch and the trip was excellent. (Other than South African Airways losing my luggage for 3 days!) The accommodation provided was also very good. Very clean and food was good and plentiful. The recommendation of Camp Kipwe in Damaraland was great as it was such an interest place to stay in and the sunset here was spectacular. Highly recommend this company and I'm definitely coming back to Namibia again. It's too beautiful for words and I'll definitely be booking with these guys and getting Augustinus to guide.",12-Jul-15,Friends,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve

There was a pride of 11 lions laying at waters edge with another smaller pride 100 yards away; behind them were hundreds of antelope, Impala, Kudu, Oryx; behind them were giraffe, and behind them ostrichesâin the distance, huge elephants were making their way to the water.

The small museum is a must, I found it very interesting. The sand can be quite difficult to walk on and there is quite a lot of broken glass and wood along with nails scattered around.

Sondra W,"Manhattan Beach, CA",Since there's not a lot to do...,"Since there's not a lot to do in Winhoek, I would give this 5 stars, as it is a ""must do"" while in Namibia.  The crafts are unique and it feels like the funds are going to the places where they are supposed to, e.g., direct to the artist.  Each artist has something different from the next artist, which is nice, as most craft areas you see the same thing over and over again.   It is very low key, and you do not feel pressured to buy, like some places make you feel.   Very pleasant way to spend the afternoon.  Top it off w/ the cafÃ©, which serves very healthy yummy food, and offers a good respite after walking around the center.",27-Sep-19,Friends,Desert Explores

Most tours start w/ Dune 45, and then you just get a ""view"" of Big Daddy before you go on to Deadvlei.  Ask your tour guide if they can do a viewing of Dunne 45, but climb Big Daddy.  It is very much worth it!  The climb itself is tough, but all worth it.  If you haven't climbed in the sand before, be aware, each step you are sinking down, and should be in fairly good shape.  The ridges have high gust winds, so be prepared for sand in your face and eyes (and every where actually!).  At the top, you look out one direction and see dunes forever.  The other direction you look down into the main attraction, Deadvlei.  Take photos, and then the fun begins - while going up you are cursing yourself, going down you are in for a treat.  Run!  Your legs will glide through the sand.  I am a snowboarder a little of floating on powder.  Save energy, as after you walk through Deadvlei, there's about a mile walk back to the parking area.",27-Sep-19,Friends,Desert Explores

sourosircar,"Sandhurst, United Kingdom","Exploring Namibia tour, fantastic holiday I ever had for my first trip to Africa.","I went on this tour, which was arranged by my travel agency based in the UK who used this company based in Namibia and it is brilliant that they did. Overall costs were quite high, especially with dinner and additional activities but it was well worth it. The jeeps and buses they use have good air conditioning, are very well suited for off roading if required with extra spare tyres (The roads in Namibia are of poor quality) and are well supplied with cool bottled water for you to take during the tour, all vital when exploring this hot, underdeveloped yet wonderful country. For the 1st week it was just me and my travelling companion exploring the southern part of the country from Windhoek, then we were joined by the rest of the group, which numbered around 17 and together we toured the centre and the northern part of Namibia. Our local tour guide Chicco was very kind, funny and supportive and thanks for him and the supporting staff at all the hotels, lodges, restaurants and game parks, we all enjoyed our holiday in Namibia very much. The trek through the Kalahari was quite a challenge but I managed to walk through the sand without too much difficulties being my first time here in Africa. We even went along the border with South Africa seeing numerous vineyards. The seaside towns of Ludertitz and Swakopmund provide a cool breeze to relieve you of the dessert heat as well as much needed rest and relaxation. My favourite part, which brought me to Namibia in the first place had to be seeing the Wild Horses of the Namib Desert, the only ones in existence in Africa. They are located near Aus along the road to Luderitz and we were lucky to see a small band and herd of them around the man made water hole in Garub. The only shameful and embarrassing thing for me was leaving my black camcorder case with a card of half my video footage inside by the roadside when we stopped to see some horses up close. The fault was mine as I was so naive and being a horse lover it is easy to get carried away so for all future visitors, be careful and keep your personal belongings with you at all time or in a safe and secure place. Chicco was very gentle with me during that time and I am very grateful of it, at least I got the other video footage as well as all photos. The hotels and lodges they have on this tour are very good with comfortable bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, various facilities including swimming pools and good food both local and international are provided at their restaurants or others nearby although you have to pay extra for this and any additional tours on offer. Seeing the Quiver Tree Forest and the Fish River Canyon, the world's 2nd largest canyon was extraordinary as was seeing flocks of pink flamingos at Walvis Bay and walking on the sand dunes at Sossusvlei including seeing various local tribes such as the Nama, Herero and San People. There is a easy walk for those who are not adventurous to walk with the higher dunes and beware of sandstorms that can happen frequently so please be prepared to cover up. The interior where the deserts are gets very hot in the daytime and very cold at night, so wear comfortable clothing and be sure to take bug and anti-mosquito spray with you because mosquitos and flies can harass you during this tour as I found out. Although malaria risk is low here, it is wise to take some tablets with you to be on the safe side. When you are out and about at remote places, be sure to take some wet wipes, deodorisers and small hand gels because toilet facilities are vey basic and you have to pay to use public ones. Apart of that, the rest will be very comfortable and you are allowed to be flexible on this tour and spend some free time on your own. On this tour you also get to see Kolmanskop, a ghost town abandoned to the desert, Diaz Point, where the fist Europeans came across Namibia, various tribal markets including a working naive village in Damaraland, ancient rock drawings made by san people centuries ago in Twyfelfontein, the unique welwitschia plants and at an additional cost a scenic flight over the sand dunes and the skeleton coast from Swakopmund, which is worth it as the view from the air is breathtaking and of course no trip to Namibia is complete without seeing much of the local wildlife at Etosha National Park located in the north of the country, which happened on the last 3 days of this tour. From there we can view wild game using the offered jeeps at the park or Sense of Africa's tour bus, which I and a few others of my group chose due to good stability and air conditioning. I was able to see elephants, rhinos, oryx, springbok, zebras, giraffes, wildebeest, hornbills, jackals and even ostriches, hyenas, lions and a leopard. I am delighted to have visited Namibia with this company and would highly recommend them. If you want to visit most of this country then I would suggest using the Explore Namibia option, the only place that is not covered is the Caprivi Strip in the North-east, which can be done separately with this company. Namibia is a great country worth seeing and it has lots of lovely landscapes, plants, wildlife, sunrises and sunsets and a diverse and multicultural society that stands to this day. Thank you very much Chicco for being a wonderful guide to me and my travelling friends and I wish you and the other staff all the best of the foreseeable future.",19-May-24,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

south180,"Perth, Australia",Group trip,Fantastic resort went to great lengths to make us all welcome the accommodations food and staff all great friendly and fresh.Sadly the drivers they use are a little cowboy in the driving skills with high speed driving on dirt roads and deflated tyres to deal with the sand makes for a very dangerous ride at speed. The evidence was a roll over the day we were leaving of a closed vehicle at speed into a corner and off the shoulder of the road.This roll over in such a remote place has ruined a holiday for several people and will have caused ongoing angst for the injuredIt was avoidable with sensible driving and speeds. This was the only thing that made this place leave a bad taste. The police were slow to respond as were the ambulance service both only  3 kms away. Fortunate first responders were a group of doctors traveling with us.Advice make sure you have very good medical evacuation insurance  Do mt be afraid to tell the drivers to slow down and drive to the conditions if they ignore you demand a stop and take the wheel yourself.It is a great place to visit but be aware of where you are and what you are dealing with.you are a long way from proper medical help.

Too proud to ask earlier.  Had no problem at all on the way back.  The sight of Deadvlei was incredible and something you cannot miss if you travel to Namibia.  We took lots of pictures and they turned out beautifully. It was also cool watching the walkers on Dune 45.  We  heard that they could slide down but that looked pretty difficult too.

A good phone camera can give you stunning pictures (wide angle) - My advice: arrive on time (at opening time) and you have the place to yourself for at least 45 mins. BEWARE there is no security guard onsite so every house you enter is at your own risk (even though they have done some reinforcements, a lot of the places are in a bad state and some ceilings are falling apart).

Edward, you could not have been more âspot-on!â  The hotels you chose for us were perfect, and in some cases just all-around beautiful.  I think the Twefelfontein Lodge was my favorite, but all exceeded my expectations on the budget restraints we gave you.  Job well done!I have to say that âNamibia Tours and Safarisâ exceeded my expectations in every respect, from start to finish.  It all started with your emails and then personal consultations on face-time.  Thank you so much for taking the time and going that extra step.  It made our vacation perfect as you were able to lay out the tour exactly as we wanted it and to fit our budget.  Once again, âNamibia Tours &Safarisâ exceeded our expectations.And as awesome as your entire operation was, we all know that once on the road, what makes the trip is the guide.  I know this because Iâve been a guide in the Rocky Mountain West of North America for 28 years.  I train guides, Iâve done marketing and sales, and as I type Iâm on a flight to Jackson, WY for two back-to-back winter tours in Yellowstone.  Charly exceeded my expectations in every category.  In fact, I learned so much from him I left Namibia on âsystem overload.â To start, his guest relation skills were above and beyond.  He was supposed to meet us on the morning of Jan 1st.  There he was the night before asking if we had questions, routing out the tour for us and generally just making us at ease.  He had maps of Namabia for each of us, and an amazing Welcome Packet (bound with color photos) I thought from the very first meeting he was above and beyond, and dang was I right!His promptness and attention to details were impeccable!  He was always there willing to lend a hand while getting ready to leave in the morning, always offering assistance, always âspot on.âHis courtesy and kindness were way above the bar!  His attention to personal needs above the bar, right on down to positioning the vehicle in a perfect way so that all had a perfect view of the wildlife we were seeing.And his sincerityâ¦amazing.  He didnât just do his job, he did it with pride and compassion for his guests.  This is not something that one learns through training, this is something from the heart!If you want me to even begin about his knowledge, Iâd be here all day.  With 400 species of birds (of which I think we saw 398 :-), he was patient, quiet, gave us an opportunity for photos and even spelled their names so we could keep a check-list!  After 28 years of guiding, I canât do Â½ the job he did at birding, and since I consider myself a âbird nerdâ this was just one of many aspects of his superb narrative skills that I immensely appreciated, admired and even envied.  Pearl spotted owlets, rollers, bee-eaters, bustards, chats, weavers, whydahs, whew, our pictures were amazing JHis knowledge of the destination was also so far above the bar that it blew my mind.  He knew where to look for wildlife.  In our first 3 days alone, he found us cheetah, 2 black rhino, 3 herds of elephants (including a new baby with pink ears), hyena, giraffe, zebra, jackal, several lions (including two mating pairs), and so many oryx and different antelope species that I lost count.  Againâ¦AMAZING!I also appreciated his respect for nature, and his love of the animals.  He even got out of our car to move a leopard tortoise off the road so it wouldnât get run over.  His enthusiasm for his job and the places he brought us to were exuded through his voice, his smile and his over-all excitement.  There was no way we couldnât be excited about a dang-dung beetle after his explanation :-)  Again, far exceeded my expectations!So anyway, I could go on and on but Edward, I think you get the point.  Your itinerary was so good that it may have messed up my financial plans.  You see, I scheduled this trip as my last international destination, my last hoorah!  But now that weâve been spoiled by Charly, I may have to reconsider.  I have seen the Okavango Delta of Botswana before (this was my third trip to Africa in fact), but with Charly as my guide, Iâm thinking there are many more parts of southern Africa I might like to return to.  Maybe northern Namibia  plus Chobe would be something to consider? Again, just a fond thank you for a job well done.And Charly, Thank-you a thousand times over.  Hope to see you again.Sincerely,Steven R Osten",10-Mar-14,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole
Steve W,"Huddersfield, UK",Thought-provoking,"Kolmanskop has a desolate beauty all of its own. Many of the shattered buildings have a contemporary look which, though beyond repair, allows you to believe that you could live there. Apart, that is, from the sand and howling wind. I can imagine the dismay on the faces of the miners' wives and children when they arrived, and the constant struggle they must have had with the sand. I would love to read/hear an eyewitness acoount of one of the children who grew up there. And all for bits of carbon.",15-Feb-16,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

steve46385,"Valparaiso, IN",Wonderful Namibia Fly-In,"Just returned from a 9 day Fly-In tour of Namibia.  The trip was arranged by Tanya at Namibia Tours and Safaris who did a great job of arranging very comfortable guest houses, lodges and game drives, etc.  The trip included Windhoek, Etosha, Swakopmund, and Sossusvlei.  To save time traveling from place to place on a relatively tight time-frame, Tanya arranged for Wings over Africa to provide us with a Cessna 210 and pilot for the entire trip.  The pilots, Fabian and Mattias each stayed with us at the lodges on their respective days and we enjoyed their company at dinner.  (N.B.  For the relatively small difference in cost, the Fly-In option saves hours upon hours of driving between locations quite distant from each other and provides a superb aerial view of the country!)  We stayed at Villa Vista Guesthouse in Windhoek, Onguma Bush Camp at Etosha, Swakopmund Guesthouse in Swakopmund and Hoodia Desert Lodge in Sossusvlei. The lodges and guesthouses were excellent, with wonderful staff and the opportunity to meet with owners and management.  Food was great and attentiveness exceptional. The guides all were very knowledgeable and gave us a wonderful exposure and understanding of the flora and fauna of Namibia.  Everything about the trip went smoothly.  During our stay in Swakopmund, we even had the chance to meet Tanya, who did the arrangements, and thank her for making the trip so memorable.",17-Jul-16,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp

stick2468,"Seattle, WA",Wonderful adventure in Botswana and Namibia,"In the spring of 2018 two friends and I took a wonderful trip to southern Africa arranged by Bianca at Namibia Tours and Safaris.  Our itinerary included a week in the Okavango Delta, Chobe National Park, and Victoria Falls, followed by a nearly three-week self-drive in Namibia to the Namib Desert, the Skeleton Coast, Damaraland, and Etosha.  Although I was at first hesitant to work online with an unseen travel agent, Bianca immediately dispelled any doubts.  Her knowledge, advice, humor, and promptness made planning easy and fun, and the arrangements were exceptional.  Our lodgings were generally mid-range with a few beyond that. All were very comfortable.  Food was very good to outstanding.  Guides and staff were courteous and knowledgeable. Transfers in Botswana were efficient.  Our 4WD in Namibia was well-equipped and included a GPS pre-loaded with our destinations. As you read this, chances are you are already sold on a trip to this wonderful part of the world.  It's a great place to visit.  The desert scenery in the Namib, the unique environment in the Okavango, the spectacular wildlife, the stupendous nighttime star shows, and the opportunities to meet Namibians and Botswanans who care deeply about these special lands--all of these make for unforgettable experiences.   Bianca helped us tailor our itinerary to meet some special requests as well as different arrival and departure times, and her support continued during the trip.  After we drove one evening into Swakopmund, the home of Namibia Tours & Safaris, she helped me find a hospital emergency room and met me there.  Next day I toured the office of Namibia Tours.  It's a good operation that obviously cares for its employees. My friends and I heartily recommend this travel company for visiting this marvelous part of the world.",8-Aug-18,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Stuart G,"London, UK","100% Recommend If You're Interested In An Amazing, Problem-Free Trip to Namibia","My wife and I were interested in booking a holiday to Namibia for our honeymoon, and received a recommendation to reach out to NTS for support. Well... we've just returned from our trip, and it was simply the best vacation we've ever been on!  From our first contact with Wilmari and the NTS team, it was a pleasure. We we're looking for advice on an optimal self-drive itinerary for 2.5 weeks to get the best yet broad experiences of the country; treating ourselves to adventures and nice lodges, and yet not breaking the bank. Wilmari listened to our needs and seemed to immediately understand what we were after, turning around a proposed route / set of accommodations that were pretty much perfect. She was patient in answering our many questions and flexible when we asked to scale-up or down certain aspects of the trip. Beyond the itinerary, so much of the other 'guesswork' that comes with exploring a new country was taken out of the equation by working with the NTS team as a one-stop shop. Additional things they helped us with as part of their services included booking all of the lodges, securing a 4x4 vehicle, car insurance, local mobile phone and sim, GPS and physical map, day by day instructions / directions / recommendations, airport transfers, booking experiences or restaurants, overall Namibia travel advice and so much more. And the best thing was that all of this information was provided in advance and readily available as PDF documents and on both a phone app and web portal. We felt super prepared heading to Namibia and more importantly, confident in the knowledge that should we need any support / advice once on the ground, we had all the local contacts we needed. Indeed, we messaged Wilmari to check in and ask advice multiple times throughout the trip, and she was super responsive and helpful.And then, the experience itself. We LOVED every single part of our trip. Every lodge was fantastic, the car was perfect, navigating long drives was seamless, our booked experiences only seemed to get better and better, and of course... the landscapes and animals were unparalleled in their beauty. We didn't want to come home. The cherry on top was that Wilmari had let each lodge know that it was our honeymoon and we received lovely little gestures at many of them, including from Wilmari in Swakopmund - truly special. If you're interested in exploring Namibia and would like support in organizing an amazing trip tailored to your needs, particularly taking the logistical burden off of you, we would 100% recommend NTS!! Thank you Wilmari, you made our honeymoon everything we wanted it to be and more.",9-Jul-23,Couples,Daan Viljoen Nature Reserve

Sue B,"Birmingham, UK",Spend more than one day in Sossusvlei Park if you can.,"If you want to see Deadvlei or climb Big Daddy I would recommend driving the 60km from the park gate and parking at the 2x4 car park. Then take the shuttle bus. The 4x4 track from the 2x4 car park is really difficult to drive and a considerable number of cars get stuck each day. To climb Big Daddy took around two hours after leaving the shuttle. Coming down is quicker and, if you want, you can come straight down the steep slope to the far end of Dead Vlei. From the 2x4 car park there is a lovely walk to Hidden Vlei. It's a couple of kilometres each way. You need to look for the sign, near to the toilets in the car park, then follow a series of wooden poles which show the way. You can make it into a circular walk. Once you get to Hidden Vlei, go down the dune onto the vlei itself. Turn right and follow the veli to the end. Then keep going and head for the trees. This will bring you back to the 4x4 track. Turn right and walk back up the track to your starting point. Total walking time around 4 hours.It's also worth climbing Dune 45, Elim Dune and visiting Sesriem Canyon.The scenery in the park is amazing with fantastic colours.The camp site shop where you get your permit for the park sells ice cream and has good loos.Most people only visit for one day. Yes you can see Dead Vlei and maybe also climb Big Daddy, but there is so much more to enjoy, I would recommend visiting the park on a number of days if you can.",29-Jul-16,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp

surya77,"Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany","A Unique Ghost Town, not to be missed!","Unique and wonderful because Kolmanskop is a ghost town in the desert, where the sand dunes move and change the landscape constantly, and because, at the same time, the buildings and homes bear witness to a bygone time when this was a very rich diamond mining town, the first in south west Africa.The dryness of the climate has helped preserve the buildings, but still,  it is so interesting to see the sand moving in and reclaiming the town.It is also a wonderful place for photographers but best to come earlier than everyone else so as to wander around alone.There are 2 tours every morning, at 9.30am and at 11am and the area closes at 1pm.To enter one needs a permit as Kolmanskop belongs to the diamond mining company NAMDEB. We bought our permit the day before at Namibian Tours and safaris, also a souvenir shop, in Luderitz. It includes the 45 min tour which one is then free to join. There were 3 guides that separated the guests into German, English and Afrikaans speakers.We were at Kolmanskop at 8am, when the gate opens, so we had an hour to explore before the tour and the arrival of most of the visitors.Visiting Kolmanskop is a day trip not to be missed. Apart from the tour and the photographic opportunities, there is also alot of information to be found on the history of the town and on diamonds, a nice curio shop and a lovely cafe that serves coffee, cakes and light meals - very much appreciated after the walk in the heat and sand!",25-Dec-18,Family,Dune 45

We enjoyed a varied blend of activity that included hiking the iconic dunes of Sossusvlei, driving through beautiful, surreal scenery (especially captivating is Damaraland), and fabulous wildlife encounters.  This was our 2nd foray into Africa and the abundance of wildlife sightings was comparable to Tanzania.  Etosha National Park was particularly rewarding in this respect.  All of the accommodations that Wilmari chose for us were top-notch in terms of comfort, ambiance, and service (I give more detailed reviews of the properties below).  We stayed in a variety of properties that put us up close and personal with unique scenery and wildlife.  The properties were largely staffed by local peoples and that was a special experience.  The absolute high point of the trip was our excellent tour guide/driver Augustinus.  We have taken wildlife adventures all over the world, and Augustinus is clearly at the top of the list for professionalism, knowledge, energy, courtesy and PATIENCE!  He is a truly wonderful human being and we enjoyed getting to know him in our 16 days together.  He was particularly wonderful when we encountered some glitches along the way involving left behind passports and illness.  He showed us things we never would have discovered on a self-drive trip such as the lichen fields in the Skeleton Coast region, and all the varieties of mammals, birds, insects and plants that thrive in the the harsh Namibian environment.    If all the guides at Namibia Tours are as great as Augustinus, any traveler is guaranteed the trip of a lifetime.My only criticism of the tour (and my husband disagrees with me) was our vehicle.  Namibia is a big country and we covered lots of miles in our 16 days.  It was extremely hot for the entirety of our trip (116F degrees on 12-25 in Sossusvlei) and never below the (90's) except in Swakopmund.  Our vehicle was not air conditioned and had vinyl seats so any afternoon that we spent in the vehicle was quite uncomfortable.  Now I appreciated that we had a large safari vehicle with a pop open roof - definitely a plus in Etosha but it would have been ideal if we had an air conditioned van for the first half of the trip then traded to the safari vehicle for the 2nd half of the trip that included Etosha.  My general advice to travelers would be to pick a time of year that it is not so hot - we did not have any flexiblity on travel dates so we took our chances with the temperatures.Here are some specific observations on our trip:  Stayed one night at Na An Kuse Lodge outside Windhoek.  This is a great introduction to Namibian wildlife as the lodge maintains a rescue center for animals that allows visitors an up close encounter (albeit behind fences) with a variety of wild cats and dogs, as well as other animals, on their feeding tour.  Especially good for young children.  We stayed in a large house that was very roomy with well appointed bathrooms.  However, the house was represented as air conditioned and if it was, we couldn't figure out how to turn it on.  The only way to get a breeze in the bedrooms was to leave the bedrooms doors open all night (ok if everyone has same sleep schedule and doesn't snore).  We requested additional towels (not enough for 5 people) and bottled water (none in room) from front desk but never received them.2 nights at Kalahari Red Dunes Lodge.  LOVED this place!  Small but comfortable individual chalet rooms with large bathrooms and plentiful a/c.  The chalets are generously spaced along a boardwalk in the Kalahari - enjoyed the tranquility and the dark, starlit nights.  We enjoyed the lodge's bikes and trails.  Large swimming pool with plenty of shaded chairs.  Very good food but the main lodge was very hot and stuffy.  Toffee the lodge meerkat was our entertainer! 2 nights at Desert Homestead Outpost in Sossusvlei.  Beautiful location high above the surrounding landscape.  Friendly staff, nice pool, individual beautiful rooms with spectacular views spread across the property. Well appointed bathrooms.  Rooms had a/c units but are powered by solar - power only lasted until around midnight then rooms were sweltering.  My husband took advantage of the option of sleeping on the roof and was quite comfortable.  The food was ok but not memorable.  For Christmas, they provided favors and singing and dancing by the staff - charming. 2 nights in Swakopmund Hotel.  Nice property with pleasant, helpful desk staff.  A special ""thank-you"" to the management for their assistance in getting our passports that we left in our room safe.  Walking distance from everything in Swakopmund.  Cute town to take a pleasant stroll.  Lots of shops but we took our stroll on a Saturday night so most were closed.  Rooms a bit dated but good size and comfortable.  Very odd that they provided a hair dryer but no outlets in bathroom.  Dining room had an excellent buffet - as it is on the coast there were numerous fresh seafood options.  In Swakopmund, we took the Laramon Tours Sandwich Harbor tour that included a drive/hike into the dunes that we all enjoyed.  In the afternoon we took the Walvis Bay Boat Cruise Tour.  The entire afternoon on the catamaran was cold and foggy so we did not see anything of note except a small seal colony and a bunch of young South Africans getting drunk on the free alcoholic beverages.  There was no escape from the cold so it was a fairly miserable few hours.  The highlight was the amazing fresh oysters that were shucked on board by the 1st mate and the friendly seals that jumped aboard during the cruise.Don't miss the Cape Cross seal colony on the Skeleton Coast - must be seen to believed.  The smell of the colony frequently reported is greatly exaggerated.  However, if you are tender of heart, the sight of hundreds of dead baby and young seals could be too much for you.2 nights at Etendeka Mountain Camp.  This was my favorite stay - a tented eco camp in Damaraland.  The experience was made special by the gracious host Dennis and his visiting wife.  The meals were my favorite of the trip - ""country cooking"" served family style at communal tables.  Chicken prepared traditionally on an open fire was delicious and memorable.  Travelling on a private tour, we rarely interacted with other tourists (our preference) but we had some enjoyable chats and shared hikes with other tourists at this camp.  Although the tents are very basic, lacking electricity but for lights, and have outdoor bucket showers, I enjoyed the break from modernity this camp provided.  One word of advice, take your bucket shower at night while the air is still warm.  By morning the air is cool and it took 3 refills of the bucket to get a decent shower - filling a bucket while still wet in cold air may be invigorating to some but unpleasant to others.  Also,he t camp doesn't provide any toiletries other than bar soap, so bring your own shampoo, etc.  More than a single bath towel per person would have been nice too (perhaps some hand towels).1 night at Mowani Mountain Camp in Damaraland.  The setting does not get better than at Mowani.  Damaraland is breath takingly beautiful - often compared to Utah.  Mowani features huge individual thatched roof suites each with fabulous views of the surrounding terrain.  Although the rooms were not air conditioned, they had large rotating fans and windows that allowed for comfort in the hot temperatures. The pool was set into rock formations overlooking the landscape.  The property would be very challenging to navigate for anyone elderly or otherwise physically challenged.   Food was very good.  We did experience a problem, however, with the rooms.  A very heavy and freakish rainstorm (according to staff) happened during dinner.  When we returned to our 3 rooms, the roofs were leaking terribly.  Our beds were wet and rain was dripping in 5 other places including on our suitcase.  We moved the beds out of the rain and dried the bedding best we could with the hairdryer.  I was disappointed that staff did not seek to help us as they had to have known rooms were experiencing problems and they did not offer anything the next day in terms of apology, except to our guide.  This is a shame because it is truly an awesome property.Be sure to visit the nearby living cultural village of the indigenous Damara people.1 night at Epacha Game Lodge.  A luxurious lodge with huge rooms and bathrooms, and air conditioning.  Everything imaginable provided in the bathrooms.  Enjoyed the outside shower and bathtub.  Huge pool although poolside chairs shaded only by umbrellas that did not provide much shade.  2 nights at Onguma the Fort.  Ok I could live here permanently!  Architecturally chic main lodge with unobstructed viewing of a waterhole frequented by lions.  Individual houses were huge with lots of special touches such as tote bags for pool items, complimentary sherry carafe and an outdoor bathtub and shower that overlooked the waterhole.  Plentiful air conditioning.  Very close to Etosha National Park.  The only drawback of property is the prohibition of walking due to the free roaming big cats.  Movement around the property requires getting driven by golf cart to and from rooms.  After all day driving safaris, a bit of walking would have been welcomed.2 nights Okonjima Bush Camp.  This place is SPECIAL!  It is home to the Africat Foundation - a not for profit organization that's mission is the conservation of Namibia's carnivores.  Individual buildings house large suites each with a separate, attached building with comfortable seating, mini fridge and ceiling fan.  Rooms each have a mini waterhole that attracted a mother warthog and her babies as well as hoofed animals and birds.  Although rooms weren't air conditioned, ceiling fans made rooms comfortable.  Very friendly staff.  Nice pool area separate from main lodge which gave it a tranquil feel. Experienced an incredible lightening storm while here.  The lodge is on a private game reserve.  Be sure to take the cheetah walk - very close encounter with free roaming cheetahs.  On the leopard tracking drive saw close-up several leopards and wild dogs.     All in all, our experience in Namibia was incredible and I highly recommend seeing this amazing country with the assistance of Namibia Tours & Safaris.",29-Jan-16,Family,Etosha_Pan

suzan142,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Missed black narrative,"The visit of Kolmanskop is interesting. Visually (to see the former city to be taken by the sand) & the history (old diamant city emerging from nowhere). The guide explained everything well. For this I recommend the visit and would I have starred 5 points. Feedback to the content of the tour: only the white narrative was unfortunately told (below some examples). I would strongly recommend the organisation to take a look at this. Its important that all narratives are told, even when they feel uncomfortable. This is also happening luckily more and more in European museums. Ex1: the guide states proudly that the build of the railway was done under 1 year, which under the extreme weather conditions is indeed amazing (missing the information that around 1400 black people (forced to work) died building the railway). Ex2: the whole tour was about where the around 350 white labourers lives & worked. The guide mentioned in one sentence that there were also around 800 black workers. When asked where they lived this was unclear. Ex3: all the information panels (around 20) in the room say nothing about the role from (forced) black labour. In the whole tour nothing was mentioned about the black narrative only the phrase that there were 800 black workers.",21-Nov-20,Couples,Desert Explores

Sydney,"Sydney, Australia",An Educational Experience,The staff were all very knowledgeable and friendly. We learned alot about Cheetahs. We observed the feeding of cheetahs which was a new experience. Also leaned about Anatolian shepherd dogs that were being sold as a deterrent against predators to farmers. We tried the ice cream made on site with goats milk which was excellent. Only downside is that they were a bit unorganised with the start time of the tours.,18-Apr-23,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole
Sydney,"Sydney, Australia","CCF has good intentions, implementation needs improvement","I fully support any institution that foster and rehabilitate wildlife, hence reason for my visit to Cheetah Conservation Fund in Otjiwarongo (Namibia).However, as described in the previous preview, I was shocked to see that the cheetahs are fed with meat laced with vitamin powders and from their respective bowls! At one point during the feeding time, one of the cheetahs accidentally tipped its assigned bowl upside-down, she picked-up the meat from the ground with her teeth, but was confused and didn't know what to do as she can't continue eating without putting back the meat on the bowl - just like a domestic cat. It does look cute, but what's going to happen when they get released in the wild? how will it survive? Release them with their respective food bowls? This is very much in contradiction with the objective of giving them a natural habitat as possible.Furthermore during the visit, the guides also mentioned that some cheetahs will never be released and are therefore being trained to become CCF's ambassadors to promote the organisation's cause and as such, those cheetahs need to get used to a certain degree of controlled interaction with visitors, but there was no such thing! In fact, any form of interaction with visitors was discouraged.In addition, CCF also advertised a misleading concept on its website where it showed a video clip of a visitor having a close interaction with a cheetah (http://www.cheetah.org/?nd=visiting_ccf_namibia), hence one of the reasons I visited the place, but it was very much the opposite. No form of interaction to be had. Overall - my suggestion is to go ahead and support the cause as it is for the benefit of the lovely cats but do not expect anything more. CCF is nothing more than a sterile zoo with Namibian post code.",26-Sep-11,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp
Sydney,Sydney,Definately worth a visit!,"We stopped in here on the way up to Etosha NP a couple of weeks ago. I had read about it in a magazine on the flight over there and found out it wasn't far off the main highway so decided to take a visit. We did the tour of the Museum, then a drive through the area the females are in, I think there was about 6 girls in the area we drove through. You get nice and close to these beautiful cats (like a couple of metres) so makes photo opportunities amazing. We missed the first session of the morning where they exercise the cats, but just watching them resting in the afternoon sun was amazing.. The road to the Fund is about 40km through farms which have joined the project so watch out for cattle, along with other wildlife like Kudu, Warthog and Oryx running across the road.. This place was a great stop on the way, the fund is doing some excellent Cheetah research and the guides are brilliant. I would definately stop back here again.",1-Sep-09,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

I ended up choosing their â8 Day Dunes and Safarisâ tour.In a word it was OUTSTANDING!    Marcel from the office in Swakopmund patiently and promptly answered all my many questions.  No question was too trivial.Everything was EXACTLY as advertised.  In fact, even better.   The lodgings were excellent as was the food.   One lodge even had their own extensive game park where we saw numerous animals on our safari one day.The excursions and local tours were well thought out.    Our guide Jurgens was wonderful.  He explained everything and was a joy to be with.  There wasnât a single glitch from airport pickup to airport dropoff.  He made the trip what it was.   Where there were options he thoroughly explained the differences.   We were in total control.  We donât do many guided tours, with a guide like Jurgens we would do many more!",9-Apr-18,Couples,Namib Desert

Tamara O,"Johannesburg, South Africa","Ghost town worth visiting, but take note of tour times!","Kolmanskop was the reason I wanted to visit southern Namibia. Astounded by the photographs I'd seen of sand dunes piling up in abandoned houses, I wanted to see it for myself. And it's definitely worth seeing. And photographing.Nobody had told us though that there are only two set tour times: 9.30am and 11am. And you can only buy tickets at the Kolmanskop gate or at the historic building in town, which is only open between 2pm and 4pm on weekdays.We arrived at the Kolmanskop gate to purchase our tickets at 2pm, only to find the place deserted (which is what one expects in a ghost town, but not in its ticket office). We called the number painted on the side of the building and asked the lady who answered about a tour. She told us we could do one the following morning. We were only in the area for one day and I begged for some other solution.Thankfully, there was a ""special tour"" happening at 2.30pm and she said we could ask whether we could join it. A ""special tour"" is just a tour outside of the normal tour hours, which costs N$85pp (R85) instead of N$65. We managed to join the group when they eventually arrived 30min late. We missed the restaurant and diamond room, which are only open between 9am and 2pm Monday to Saturday.The tour guide, Christo, was a lovely character. A young chap fluent in english and Afrikaans, he knows his stuff and has a lively manner. He'll even sit down at the piano and bang out a tune, singing along, as part of the tour.The tour itself lasts about 45minutes, after which you can wander around the houses at your leisure. We were fascinated by the advanced German technology that little Kolmanskop boasted, from its ice-making facilities (impressive in 1908 in the middle of the desert) to its bowling alley.I found the place a little sad - the last inhabitants only moved out 50years ago, although the town was in decline just a few years after it was founded.Wandering around afterwards, I realised quite quickly that for an amateur photographer like me, the shots I will capture will be ridiculously similar to those that hundreds of happy snappers have shot before me.Still, I do think it was worth it to see it myself and snap my own pics.",18-Apr-12,Couples,Desert Explores

In fact we also saw jackals wandering around inside the camp. Many people thronged around the waterhole at dusk and after dinner - these were all staying on site. In fact there were far too many people for comfortable viewing and it appeared to us that many were not there to watch the wildlife but to chat loudly and drink to excess - this rather spoiled what should have been quite special evenings",6-Jun-18,Couples,Namib-Naukluft National Park

The file with all the infos about the lodes and things to do was very helpful. Our trip was unforgetful and thanks to NTS we had no bad surprises. There were only few minor things that would have been helpful:Otjitotongwe Cheetah Farm: would be good to know the time of the Cheetah tour (luckily we just arrived 15 min. before it started)Mount Etjo Safari Lodge: we arrived around lunch with the intention to eat there, the told us that we should have booked lunch beforehand, luckily they were flexible that we could eat there as there was nothing around to have lunchSwakopmund Sandwich Harbour Tour with Desert Tracks:Initially I wanted to book this tour with Turnstone Tours, apparently Chantelle wasn't able to get through to them so she used Desert Tracks instead. We didn't like the tour that much. First of all the pick up time was postponed by 3 times. At the end we couldn't even pass to see the lagoon as the tide was too high. The guide told us if we would have gone earlier it would have been possible. So why did he postpone the pick up time then from 9am to 11 am?Furthermore, the we were 4 and 3 sitting in the backseats, which were very unconfortable as there wasn't much space for the legs, luckily my 11 year old was sitting behind the driver otherwise it would have been unbearable for my 1m83 tall older son.

Tennessee,Tennessee,Beware of the gift shop,"We visited last summer with a tour group. It was good to see the cheetahs up close but all you see is them pacing back and forth waiting to be fed.  The group had a lasagna lunch there that was good.  However, the gift shop is why the low rating.  We purchased shirts, hats, earrings and other things to help them out.  After the initial purchase, we still had more time there and my husband wanted another shirt. We didnât open the wrapping that it was packaged in because we didnât feel the need since it was a new, packaged shirt.  When we got home one of the shirts (the second one we went back to buy) was a beige/khaki color and had red spots all over the middle and back of it that looked like paint and magic marker.  I emailed them asking if they could send another shirt and sent pictures of the damaged one.  After attempting twice to email them over a period of a few weeks and not receiving a reply, I notified the tour company.  They contacted them and was advised they would mail me another shirt but asked if I could wait 2 months because the owner would be coming to the U.S. and it would be cheaper for them to mail it from the U.S.  I agreed and gave them my mailing address as requested.  Two months later I received an email advising me of the location of the  in the U.S. where the owner was that was 2,000 miles away from me, and said I had to pick it up in person or pay for the postage myself.  I notified the tour company and they then said the Cheetah conservation advised they would refund the amount but needed specific authorization codes from my credit card purchase.  My credit card company advised they could refund without any codes - yet they refused to refund.  And since I waited patiently for them to mail it, the time has now been too long to dispute the charges.  That is a poor way to do business with people who were buying their logo items to support them.  Donât expect much when visiting as far as interacting with the cheetahs- and be sure to check everything well if you buy anything from their gift shop. And beware that they will not work with you if you have any purchase issues.",6-Mar-23,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp

Apparently Namibia is leading the way in southern Africa in its cheetah conservation programs across the southern part of the continent.This is one of those programs, and whilst those cheetahs here are not going to be released back into the wild - the CCF is certainly doing a magnificent job in education, which is already impacting on the conservation of this magnificent, but endangered species.",4-Dec-15,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

Texas,Texas,Incredible Organization,"CCF is an incredible organization that does amazing work around the world to save cheetahs.  Their headquarters in Namibia is a wonderful place to visit.The facilities are impressive.  Not only do they care for three dozen cheetahs, they have a DNA lab, a veterinary clinic, a scat-detection dog team, a model farm, a creamery, and a large piece of protected land.  All parts of their facility are worth a visit, simply to see the wide variety of ways that they have discovered to support the cheetahs.  A lot of it is quite unexpected - for instance, they are involved with an initiative called Bushblock.  They clear overgrown bush from the land and turn it into firewood.  Clearing the bush allows the cheetahs freedom to run and hunt, and the firewood generates a source of sustainable energy.  The clearing also provides local farmers a source of revenue.  Its just another clever way CCF helps cheetahs.They also do a great deal to contribute to research.  For instance, their scat-detection dog teams find scat in the deserts which is submitted to the DNA lad for analysis.  This allows CCF and other organizations to build database about cheetah populations, and populations of other animals in the area.  CCF also raises Anatolian Shepherds, large dogs that local farmers use to protect their herds.  The livestock protection dogs scare off cheetahs and greatly reduce the likelihood that farmers will feel the need to kill cheetahs.And of course, there are the cheetahs themselves.  CCF has about three dozen cheetahs at its facility.  Some were injured and are treated by CCF's veterinary staff.  Many times these cheetahs will be returned to the wild after they are rehabilitated.  Other cheetahs were orphaned, and turned into CCF by local farmers.  If they were particularly young when they were found, they cannot be returned to the wild because they will have missed out on learning critical hunting skills from their mothers.  But they find a good home at CCF, were they are fed, cared for, and can be viewed and admired by visitors.One highlight at CCF is the cheetah run.  Several zoos in the U.S. have similar events, but CCFs is unique.  CCF takes guests into a small pen in the middle of a large enclosure.  The pen is spearated from the rest of the enclosure only by a 4-foot fence.  Once the guests are inside, the staff release several cheetahs.  They then intermittently run a cloth lure along a circular track.  The cheetahs can chase the lure as often as they see fit.  Each catch gets a reward, but the cheetahs are remarkably fair - seeming to let one another take turns at the chase.   For 30 minutes or so, you can watch the cheetahs chase, play, rest, and eat their rewards.  CCF has a number of other cheetah related activities, each worth the time.  And they own a large piece of land adjaced to the facility where you can go out on game drives in the evening.  We say myriad species of antelope, giraffes, jackals, ostriches, and many bird varieties.  You also get a gorgeous view of the Waterburg Plateau.Most folks will visit CCF for the day, but you can also stay overnight.  We stayed at the Babson House, a two-bedroom cottage.  The facilities were quite nice, and overlook one of the cheetah enclosures.  It doesn't get much better than having breakfast on a porch while watching cheetahs play just a few feet away!  The staff was excellent.But no matter how long you stay, CCF is worth a visit, and the organization is doing incredible work.  I would highly encourage everyone who loves animals to support CCF.",23-Nov-18,Family,Namutoni

Itâs taken me a while to get to this review as Iâve been busy writing TripAdvisor reviews for all of our accommodation and a few Namibia articles for The Adventurous Flashpacker site. The service was very individual and I didnât feel at all like we were being sold a package tour. Bianca was very responsive and had good ideas re locations and accommodation, and changed the itinerary many times to suit what we were after. We went with a fairly classic northern Namibia itinerary, and then added a couple of âglampingâ style hikes along the way which were amazing, in particular Tok Tokkie trails. All the lodges we stayed at were wonderful, and Iâve written separate reviews about each of those. I usually book all my travel independently, but really appreciated the assistance from Namibia Tours & Safaris (one central booking instead of over 10!), and the peace of mind knowing that theyâd be there to help if any issues arose during our trip. I am already dreaming of a return trip to Namibia and will definitely use Namibia Tours & Safaris again.",12-Aug-18,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

themillersindiana,"Carmel, IN",Awesome guided 11-day tour of Namibia!,"Namibia Tours & Safaris prepared an awesome 11 day safari for my wife and I and our two children ages 20 and 22.  Bianca did a great job working with me to plan the agenda and lodges according to our specific interests and desires - she was very responsive and flexible to our needs.We have to thank our excellent guide Marius Siemens as well for making the journey a great one.  He is very experienced and gave us great advice on what to do and what to see - we really appreciated his honesty about what was good or bad about each activity, restaurant or other choice we needed to make and he fully supported whatever we decided.  He was extremely professional, helpful and efficient - getting us electrical adapters when ours turned about to be the wrong ones for example -and was very organized and fast, enabling us to get the most out of every hour of our trip.  We started calling him Marius âMario Andrettiâ Siemens because of his speedy (but very safe) driving!Regarding the specific sites we saw:- We started in Windhoek and drove straight to the Desert Homestead Lodge in Sossusvlei where we spent two nights.  Food was great and the sleeping quarters were also excellent.- Climbing the Big Daddy dune was a highlight we recommend to anyone who goes to Namibia!  My wife and I had to stop for rests multiple times but it was well worth it.- The Namibia Naukluft Park is beautiful, like nothing we have seen before.  Spending a full day there was excellent and enough time to see the sights and get in some climbing.- We then drive to Swakopmund with a stop in Walvis Bay to see the flamingos in the lagoon which was good but could also easily be skipped for more time in Swakopmund.- We spent two nights at the Desert Breeze Lodge in Swakopmund.  The lodge was very nice with great views of the dunes but the location on the edge of town was not ideal.  I would recommend picking a location more central to allow for walking around during the day.  Swakopmund was a nice town with some great restaurants but the best part was going to Desert Explorers for riding ATVs on the dunes.  This was fantastic!  We also rode down the dunes on sleds (like large pieces of cardboard) and on sand boards (snow boards) which was also fun, but having to walk back up the dune after each run was exhausting - we each tried both methods only once.  I would recommend the ATV combo with dune sledding only (we did the ATVs only one day and the combo the next day).- Next we drove up the Skeleton Coast to Twyfelfontein.  We stopped at the Seal Colony which we thought was incredible - hundreds of thousand of seals all in one place!  We were lucky in that it did not smell bad at all compared to what we were warned about - got lucky that day with the temperature and winds.  Highly recommend this stop as well.  The rest of the Skeleton Coast was not much to see until we got near our lodge  Doro Nawas in Damaraland where we spent one night.- This lodge was also very nice although the food was not very good.  We saw Desert elephants right from the lodge which was incredible and spent the last part of the day relaxing on the deck.  The next day Twyfelfontein was very interesting, seeing the ancient etchings on the rocks, and I would also recommend this - plus it was a good place to stop on our way to Etosha.  We skipped the Burnt Mountain and Organ Pipes which I think was a good decision based on Mariusâs advice, giving us more time at Etosha.- We arrived in the afternoon at Etosha in time for our first safari drive in the park.  It was incredible!  The first watering hole we saw was packed with more animals than The Lion King!  We had a great first day, seeing 3 of the big 5 and many other animals.- We stayed one night at the Etosha Safari Lodge which was very good - food a bit better than in Doro Nawas...- The next 2 days we spent in Etosha with two nights at the Onguma the Fort lodge.  We canât say enough about Etosha or this lodge - the safari drives were incredible with multiple parades of elephants, zebras and giraffes going right in front of our truck.  We saw lions each day also, with our only disappointment being no sighting of cheetahs or leopards (although others were more successful so we were just unlucky).  The lodge is beautiful with excellent food and great service - definitely the best place we stayed.- The next day we drove to the AfriCat Foundation in Okonjima.  I had booked this in case we did not see cheetahs or leopards, which are my favorite animals, in Etosha and Iâm glad I did.  This lodge was also beautiful with excellent service and good food.  We had excellent drives that afternoon and the next morning and saw 6 leopards and 1 cheetah and many more animals with our fantastic guide Emmanuel.  This was well worth it, although if we had seen the cats in Etosha maybe it would not have been necessary.  However, the lodge and the people were so good and the work they do so necessary that Iâm glad we went.- After that we headed back to Windhoek for one night at the Hilton and then a flight out the next day.  We stopped in Otjiwarongo for lunch and a visit to the Crocodile Farm on the way.  It was interesting to see the crocodiles but I wouldnât go out of my way for it - the timing just worked our for us.  The lunch was good except for the bees!!!  Weâve never experienced so many bees at one time - seriously over 20 of them attacking our food!   My wife gave up eating and in  the end the bees won.  I would never go back for a meal there even though the food was fine.- We spent a few hours walking around Windhoek and shopping.  It was fine but I also wouldnât recommend sacrificing time at Etosha or other sites to walk around the city.  The Hilton  Hotel was also very nice and a perfect location right in the center of town - I would recommend it highly.Thanks again to Bianca and especially Marius!!!  I recommend both highly for your safari trip to Namibia!!!",18-Aug-18,Family,Namutoni

Although there is absolutely nothing else to see except sand, and to do, it is so remarkable, every dune has its own story, every dead tree is just unique, and being the only alive thing in there, opens a lot of interesting thoughts in your head (at least it did to me ;). Make sure you wear shoes that are ""sand-proof"" as the sand is extremely hot, and there is some walking to be done from the parking to the actual Deadvlei. There were plenty of people screaming wearing flip-flops. You also need 4x4 vehicle to get to the actual Deadvlei, otherwise you will have to park as far as the cars can go, and there is organized 4x4 safari truck that takes you in and back for some R100 a person.

Even being a regular walker, I needed assistance a couple of times getting on and off large rocks, and the very high temperatures did not help.

Thomas H,"Perth, Australia",Amazing Tour Company,"I found this company online and read through their reviews here and they seemed like a great company. I planned out where I wanted to see and roughly where I wanted to stay based off the information they share on their website. They share previously booked trips and show where people go and where they stayed. I found the common places in the different areas I wanted to go and sent them an unusually long and detailed e-mail with the places I wanted to see/photograph and then what I wanted from my solo self-drive. I feel bad for Bianca who had to read through it and use that to help me plan my trip. However it was a great service and really helpful. She helped me fill in a few blanks I had and answered all my questions. I probably could have booked everything however it was nice to have a experienced person in the area do that and be able to also help me throughout my trip. After she responded to my ridiculous e-mail, she helped me iron out the trip and we went from there. It was really easy and she was great. Her responses were quick both while we were planning my trip as well as after when I had questions as my trip got closer. Bianca was very good and helping me organize my time and locations for what I wanted to do. She booked everything and organized all the information for me. Namibia Tours and Safaris also printed it and sent me an electronic copy. Very detailed and broke down what I could do in each spot with information about the area or where I was staying. Unfortunately the rental car company didnât give me my GPS which would of had all the location preprogrammed into it. However I had all the maps from Bianca and a local SIM card as per her advice.I am sure most people contact them with a very general idea of what to do and they help them plan out a trip either from their packages or tailor something for them. But it was really nice that Bianca worked with my detailed plan I had made. Once I got to Namibia, Bianca had done a good job of making sure all my transfers and rental car was sorted out and seamless. During the trip I had some issues with the alignment of my truckâs wheels and the tread of my wheels getting bald. The rental car company wasn't super helpful and I had also messaged Bianca. Bianca was right on it and got the rental car to organize my truck to get inspected in Swakopmund which was great. It all worked out and she really helped with that process. If she hadn't had helped, I could have either been potentially taken advantage of by the rental car company or had some major tire issues later in my trip. So having someone to help coordinate and get things done when I was busy driving from place to place or trying to do the things I wanted to do was nice. The booklet they gave me when I arrived was really helpful to have and go through on the trip. I knew most of the things and had the digital copy of it. However it was nice to have some of the research done so I didnât need to when I arrived in each place. All and all it was quite helpful. I would highly recommend booking a trip with Namibia Tour and Safaris because if something does go wrong you have someone else to help you sort things out which may prove very helpful. I could of had a very miserable time with my vehicle however they helped make sure that didnât happen. Namibian roads are at times really terrible so you never know what could happen as well as just being on a trip like that in a fairly remote country. Bianca was really useful and helpful and definitely helped organize my trip and make sure it didnât all fall apart like my two front wheels. â¨â¨Thank you again for all the help ironing out my trip, booking it all and then help with my tire fiasco. I will definitely give you guys a call again when I come back Namibia someday.",4-Jul-18,Solo,Swakopmund Museum
Thomas H,"Perth, Australia",Great Waterhole For Everything but Predator Cats,"This waterhole is right side the lodge and some of the fancy rooms you can get look out onto it. It is close to the campsites and easy to walk to it. It is also floodlit at night and really interesting to see at night. So I would recommend staying one night there at the campsite/lodge to experience that at night. It gets cold but it is worth it. I would recommend having a glass of wine or something and sitting there watching the animals come and go. The waterhole was cool to go to in the day and at night. It usually had a good flow of all the animals but the predator cats when I was there. Elephants, rhinos, giraffes. You'll see when you drive around the park that any of the impala/deer species there are everywhere, same with zebra. But seeing a lot of elephants, rhinos and giraffes there at night was interesting.",4-Jul-18,Solo,Dune 45
Thomas H,"Perth, Australia",Giant Dune,Unfortunately I was too busy photographing Deadvlei in the fog to hike up Big Daddy before the sun was high enough it would be a little much. However photographing people walking up and down the dunes from the pans is very cool as they are incredibly dwarfed by the size of the dune. Just like small ants walking on it. Add in some fog and it was a really cool scene. I have seen photos from the top and I am sure it is definitely worth it. Probably best if you stay more than 2 nights in Sesriem so you can get to Deadvlei and photograph it before it is busy and then the next day hike up Big Daddy for the sunrise. Awesome place.,4-Jul-18,Solo,Dune 45
Thomas H,"Perth, Australia",Definitely a Must (and for sunrise),"This was one of the most interesting spots I've seen before in my life and I've seen a few interesting things before. Fortunately I got to see it in a much different light as it was foggy when I was there. I got to see it slightly in the morning light after the sun burnt off the fog but it was amazing. Definitely get there early, well before everyone rushes in by the truck load after the main gate opens. I stayed in the Sesriem Campsite so that I could get into the small gate an hour before the main gate opens. That way you can get there before the sun rises and the swarms of tourists come in. I don't want to stereotype, but roughly as I was done with most of my photos, ~50 tourists from Asia came over the dune beside the pan and just spread out all over the pan. So thankfully I was there early or else I would have been editing out many tourists from my photos. Any large tour group could do this while you are there so make sure you get there early for your photography. Also, please respect the spot and not damage the trees. It really is a unique and awesome thing to see and I hope it lasts for anyone in the future to see.",4-Jul-18,Solo,Spitzkoppe

Thomas W,"Plainview, NY",3 weeks in Namibia with NTS,"My wife & I did a tour withÂ NamibiaÂ tours & safaris in Sept 2022 with Bianca as organizer & Jakes as guide/driver. We spent 2 weeksÂ withÂ them & one week independently. We have done most of Africa and NamibiaÂ was the last major safari left to do. We always hired a guide/driver and always had landcruisers with pop-up roof.NTS organized it all for us. The basics were fine. We made payment easily with credit card, email responses were fast, though only once a day due to time difference. Luckily I had done a lot of the planning on my own. We chose to go only north of Winhoek & just do wildlife viewing.Â We stayed at Mount Etjo (saw tons of wildlife with local driver), Omaruru (amazing place-wow), Brandberg white lady lodge (saw desert elephants),Grootberg & Palmwag lodges (waste of time as drought meant no wildlife so game drives were a waste), Hotabetere (skip this), Okaukuejo (amazing water hole, we loved this lodge, ignore the negative reviews), Onguma was the best lodge ever in every way), Kifaru (tons of rhino, a must inÂ Namibia), and finally Naankuse lodge.Â The lodges were fine (we picked them), the vehicle had no breakdowns, driver was on time, always helping withÂ paperwork & luggage & all the details needed. We had a terrific time but could have cut out a week in Damaraland.Â  NTS should have warned us that due to drought there is no wildlife left in this area as everyone kept telling us. We went for rhinos thinking there are hundreds running around but in fact we were told there are 6 in the area and we tracked 1 or 2 on our tracking safari. Not what we expected.Problem 1We were told theÂ Nissan Patrol will replace the Landcruiser and its the same thing. The vehicle was actually terrible for viewing. The back part was raised a foot higher so that we faced the A/C wall. TheÂ visibility was only sideways like in a train. We could not see upcoming animals until it was too late. We never saw this issue with a landcruiser. Driving for hours in a closed box gets boring. In addition the (not adjustable) seats were angled so I keptÂ sliding forward over bumpy roads so I ended up holding onto something the whole time during the drive. Not comfortable. Awful safari vehicle.Problem 2Jakes was a nice guy but we rarely saw wildlife. We drove hours on end with nothing. We switched to lodge safari & immediately saw tons of large wildlife. I felt bad but, we decided to use the lodge game drives & we paid extra of course for this. But it was night & day. In addition Jakes would not get close to the elephants which was our favorite sighting. Other cars would be close & he would say how we can not push themÂ & get trampled and seemed paranoid compared to otherÂ guides weÂ had. So we would be across the road watching the cars that were right next to the elephants. We have done many safaris & know how close you can get to elephants but this was a disappointment to us.Save moneyNTS wanted us to pay $300 for water forÂ 2 weeks! This sounded ridiculous since all otherÂ tours offered the water free. We negotiated that I would pay for it & went into a supermarket day 1, and bought 24 large 2 liter bottles for $20 which lasted 2 weeks with half left over at the end. In fact hotels & game drives always gave us extra free water. Don't pay for water huge amounts!We were also charged for driver accomodationsÂ before & after the trip. But then the last day, when we would have liked to do an extra game drive,Â  we had to leave the lodge at 8am so that driver can get home in time. Then what did the accomodationÂ go towards? We would have loved a morning drive in Etosha 6:30-10:30 which the lodge gave but we could not do this since we would have to leave 10:30 instead of 8. As it happened we left at 9 and driver took a short cutÂ which ate up an hour extra & we got stuck behind barriers to theÂ next lodge due to NTS not getting the combination to open the gates. Minor issue but it ate up an hour of our time.Save more moneyDon't hire car & driver for lodges close to Windhoek. We had transfers from lodge to lodge which saved us lots of money. Once you get far you will need to keep the car & driver.Don't pay extra for driver to do game drives. We usually saw no wildlife with the drivern. We saw tons of wildlife withÂ theÂ lodge drivers. They radio back & forth or know where to go, & they start way earlier. We saw almost everything both before & after NTS picked us up.Â Don't go to Damaraland looking for rhino tracking. Firstly there is no wildlife due to drought past 10 years soÂ noÂ game drives. There are a handful of rhinos only and it is very uncomfortable tracking. I would not repeat it if they paid me. We spent literally 9 hours in a car on bumpy or non existant roads on rocks and waited in the car for hours while the trackers went out searching. Tracking on foot means they go on foot while we sit in the hot car. Finally you always find the rhino sitting under a tree resting & we had to stay so far that a camera photo was useless to save. So skip Grootberg or Palmwag. The resident elephant Jimbo was not there for a month so do not go hoping to see him!We had amazing rhino tracking on foot in Kifaru lodge and Mount Etjo and we saw rhinos close up in Omaruru every day and we also saw rhino in Etosha. Onguma was the best lodge, I thank NTS for recommending it.Â In summary we loved the trip but it could have been even better & more comfortable. Insist on a landcruiser & if you are not going for wildlife, NTS is a great tour company. For wildlife we were disappointed and the vehicle really annoyed me every day.",22-Dec-22,Family,Namutoni

Tiffy_Bird,"La Plata, MD",First-rate collection of ancient petroglyphs,"In just a 45-minute guided walk at Twyfeltontein, you can see literally hundreds of San (or Bushman) rock engravings that date between 2,000 and 10,000 years old. One of the largest concentrations of petroglyphs in Africa, Twyfelfontein is said to hold more than 2,000 rock engravings, and the path takes you along an impressive array.When you pay the admission fee, you are assigned a local guide to accompany you. Our interpreter, Arthur, was great.  He explained what the symbols meant (several pertained to water sources in this arid land), the significance of certain animals to the San people (giraffes indicated water), and he even described Bushman hunting techniques.  Arthur readily answered all questions and kept a lighthearted, but informative tone. In short, if you like ancient art, culture, or geology, there is much to learn at Twyfelfontein.  TIPS:  Aim for an early morning hike. I went in August, Namibian winter, and even so, it gets very hot by late morning in this exposed location.  And, whenever you go, take water on your trek.  You will need to do some very easy climbing along boulders and rocks and there are a couple of elevated platforms with stairs.

The contrast was exciting. Even though I saw many beautiful photos of Deadvlei beforehand, I was not disappointed. Go.  The 20-minute walk to the pan is easy.

I am glad I did this hike as the view is one of the most unique in the world! I would not do it again - and I'd do it differently. Don't go in December - height of summer - unless you are ok with 100 + degree temperatures. We started at 6:00am and it was too hot for me on our way down. We walked through the salt pan - not the main one  - and hiked a small dune/ridge and then up. It gets steep fast and the sand just slips away from your steps. If you can take one - use a camel back and keep drinking water. You can pay to get into the park early - do it. Start as early as you can. Ware closed toe shoes - I saw people walking with flip flops, which I'm sure melted later in the day. If you can carry some water to wet down a scarf around your neck, that would be good too. Take lots of breaks to catch your breath. Of course it is different for people of different athletic levels, but be smart. It is HOT probably any time of year and dry. I'm in decent shape and we did in an hour and 40 mins the way we approached it.

There is a hike across lots and lots of sand, but once you are in the pan area, it is breathtaking.  As there are fewer travelers and tourists during the pandemic period, we were able to visit this area with very few people around, picture taking was easy as there was no one to get in the way.  After our hike, we drove over to an area where there was a beautiful water hole and had lunch.  A jackel and Oryx visited us during our time and upon our departure, we hit one of the strongest windstorms the area had seen in many years.

We sent an email to their website with the rough details of what we were looking for, and they responded quickly, letting us know they could  plan a customized trip for the three of us--a couple and our adult son. This was especially important since we planned the trip only a month before our departure. Kady Bernstein was our consultant and she was very flexible when we needed to change the duration and scope of our trip, but still made sure she met all of our requests. She gave us good recommendations and advice, and we were happy with all of our activities and accommodations. In fact, we had the best chalet in front of the water hole in Etosha Park. Our guide, Mark Hays, was awesome. Originally a school teacher, he was incredibly knowledgeable about so many different things--geography, fauna, flora, culture--and he could spot animals and birds a mile away. He was also a safe driver and we felt very comfortable with him whether on a highway, dirt road or off-road in the bush. He never steered us wrong, whether it was deciding on a restaurant, searching for wildlife or setting our daily itinerary. We were in a versatile vehicle--plenty of space, windows that opened, and a raised roof so we could get great photos and views of the wildlife.

Before we committed to NTS, I asked for itinerary ideas and quotes from the four top rated Namibian travel agencies.  There was no comparison!  NTS and Veronica provided a unique itinerary, was super responsive, found special accommodations (not offered by others), fine-tuned the plan based on many iterations and back-and-forth with us, was the only agency that could secure the car we wanted (Fortuna 4x).  In addition, they cost less than the others. I don't know how they do it. I emailed what our family of four was interested in for our 19 day self-drive trip to Namibia.   Veronica assembled different itineraries, and together we refined our plan.  Then Veronica presented fantastic, unique accommodation options based on our mid-level lodge requests.  A few of our initial picks were not available, so Veronica came up with excellent alternatives.  She also provided recommendations on special places to visit and other logistical tips.We loved the Fortuna 4x car Namibia Tours & Safaris got for us, and all the little things they provided incl. maps, wildlife guidebooks, bandanas etc., and welcome/orientation meeting when we first arrived in Windhoek.

It is a bit of walking through the rocks, but the guide was well able to talk about the art and, as bluelens explains, it is much about shamanism and becoming part of the animal world partly for hunting purposes. I felt the guide could have gone a bit further and brought out more of the discussion and less of the history of the white family and the modern name, as these are not what the site is about.

Torino,torino,GOOD REALITY.,"It is a very beautiful place, born from the passion of a woman in love with cheetahs who spent a lot of time studying their behaviors, habits, before creating this center for the protection of this special at risk. Cheetahs are threatened by illegal wildlife trafficking, shepherds killing them to defend their flocks, attacks by other predators.In this center they welcome cubs removed from poaching, wounded and sick specimens; if possible, after treating them, they reintroduce them into the wild with a radio collar, if they are not in a condition to be released they keep them there treating and feeding them. During the visit you can see them very closely and, at special times, watch their meal. Each one is explained the story, where they come from, why they are there and what their future destiny will be. There are also some elderly specimens who have reached an age not possible in nature and who spend their lives there, among adequate care and food.In addition to this there are goats that are raised for milk and a very nice project involving the breeding of anatolian sheep dogs. These dogs are given to shepherds to defend their flocks and thus reduce the need for man to have to kill the cheetah. This offers a concrete solution to the problem of the cheetah's attack on livestock and raises human awareness of its preservation. We saw some adult dogs and a beautiful litter, who will become accustomed to becoming the keeper of the flock, putting puppies in contact with livestock from an early age.The project is very nice, it is absolutely worth visiting the center and supporting it.There is also a cafe selling products of their own production, very good.",2-Sep-24,Couples,Waterberg National Park

trainfan2000,"Hamilton, Canada",A Town Frozen in Time,"This is a fascinating trip to make if you are in Luderitz. The town was an old German diamond mining town that was abandoned in 1954. What you see is a deserted town but the buildings are still in good shape - although filling with sand. The main building still houses a bowling alley that looks like it is waiting for someone to start a game. The town's hospital, school and several stately homes wait to be explored. The sand is slowly engulfing the buildings and the town producing an eerie feeling as you walk through the deserted hospital and other buildings. The wind is constant here and increases in the afternoon. The sand is everywhere so wear appropriate footwear, take a hat and sunscreen. There is a reasonably priced restaurant in the main building. The tour guides vary in approach so see if you can find a good one or maybe switch tours. Our guide stayed in one place and pointed things out, another guide took his tour to the buildings and explained what they were seeing.",4-Jul-14,Couples,Namib Desert
Trav0108,"Hartbeespoort, South Africa","See it now, gone tomorrow","Visited rock art engraving World Heritage site at Twyfelfontein in March 2016. Guide allocated at the site to our small group not well informed about engravings, could not answer questions effectively. Appeared that it was a bother for her to take us through the site. There is no conservation of the engravings and I foresee that it will be completely eroded off the rocks within a decade or two even though it has been around for 6000 thousand years. The area has become more arid and the fine sand is blasting the surface off the rocks. There is evidently 2000 rock art engravings in and around the mountain but we were shown only about twenty.No attempt has been made to make the path up the rocks safe for tourists. We slipped and slid on stones up and down the pathways that are strewn with rocks and boulders. The reception area toilets at the site are pits in the ground with toilet pans fitted over the holes, there is a most awful stench in the air. I noted that nobody lingered after viewing the rock art even though there is a curio shop and a small area that has tables and chairs. Total disappointment.",28-Mar-16,Family,Dune 45

If it were cooler I would have enjoyed this more but the heat and fact that you're walking up some stairs as well as very rocky, uneven uphill surfaces made it not really worth it to me. Plus after an hour it's like enough already, I get it.  I could have easily skipped this or maybe just seen one rock's worth of carvings and been fine.",30-Oct-17,Friends,Namutoni

Place is extremely fabulous. generally people directly walk to the dealvlei site but best way to feel this place one must hike the duns till high you can and fall from there to down at deadvlei haha i mean come down :) and reach to base and then u realize how it is actually worthy. and i'm happy and proud that i reached down to site from tallest duns over there. that experience was life time memories..  Apart of this there are two sites one that people use to  visit and there is also one side actually same looking but many trees fells down which was as well as place to visit if you're photographer and good explorer which i recommended highly :) if you stay inside that you're lucky to be on this place 1 hour earlier then people who stay outside. closing time is almost same for all of us.,21-Nov-14,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

TraveldragonToronto,Toronto,An amazing trip in Namibia organized by Namibia Tour & Safari,"We are a group of photographers looking for a customized tour of Namibia. My husband and I booked a self drive tour with this company 3 years ago and found them very responsive and helpful. When we had an accident on the road, they responded immediately to pick us up from the accident site, took us to the next destination and arranged to rent another 4X4 for us to continue with our trip. So we decided to use their escorted tour this time for our group of 10.We are very specific with our requirements and demanded to have guide/ driver knowledgeable with photography. We also want to have sunrise and sunset shoot daily, meaning the guides have to work long hours. Wilmari was our advisor who planned the itinerary with us. Their quote is lower than other companies in spite of the additional demand. We were assigned two wonderful guides/ drivers who happily escorted us to all the best sites for photography at the best time. They seem to enjoy the trip as much as we did in spite of the long hours of driving. They are both very good and complement each other. Augustein is most accommodating and will do anything to meet our requests. Mark is humorous, knowledgeable and has photographerâs eyes. We were utterly satisfied with their service. We became friends and are still keeping in touch after the trip.We  definitely will recommend friends to use their service.

TravelFamily2012,"Edmonton, Canada",Definitely worth a visit,"This is a well-designed and interesting display of rock art. It was unclear to us if you 'had' to go in with a guide, but we did. Our guide was fairly knowledgeable but seemed somewhat ambivalent, simply provided a rote recitation of meanings and history. It would have been nice to have had a little - even a tiny little - enthusiasm so our kids could get interested. I did notice that some of the other guides were more animated so it was probably just our luck of the draw. The exhibits in the main house were very informative and well done (though our guide contradicted some of that information so it was a little confusing). One thing that we were left confused by was the issue of 'tipping'... some people told us that the guides get no salary... others said yes they do. And there was a sign at the facility that said if you tip over 100 you have to tell the desk - so it gets included in their salary? I honestly don't know and found this whole issue baffling. Besides that, this is a beautiful site and an excellent exhibition.",26-Oct-12,Family,Okaukuejo waterhole

You have to go through the sand 4x4 area to Sossusvlei (65 km from the entrance gate).  Just as you are through the sand area and arrive in Sossusvlei, you will see a sign ""Deadvlei""  You do not need to climb a dune, just a flat walk of just over a kilometer to the Deadvlei (to the right of the dune if you look at the ""Deadvlei"" sign board in front of you)  Unfortunately you cannot use the bathrooms at Deadvlei or Sossusvlei they are in a terrible state (have to go back to the entrance gate).",19-Jan-15,Family,Namib-Naukluft National Park

Ashlee Maree was the person who arranged this private tour for 4 of us and did an outstanding job.  In fact, the reason I originally chose Namibia Tours and Safaris was because she was so responsive and enthusiastic.  Our guide for the approx. 10 days in Namibia was Theo, He took excellent care of us and was friendly and very competent.  I also trusted his driving.  We asked him endless questions which he patiently answered and even helped my friend and I to find fabric stores.  One evening we were joined by his wife Elsie who appeared in beautiful native dress.  She was excellent company and we appreciated her explanations of tribal customs, dress, food and much more.

Traveller123CT,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Incredible!,"This was the reason for visiting Luderitz, and wow! It was so well worth it. We drove in our car to Kolmanskop and paid the NAD 75 per person entry fee. This entitled us to join the tour at 9.30am. I'm pleased we joined the early tour because the wind picks up, and by 11am, the next tour, the sand was blowing around as it got windier and windier, and hotter and hotter. The tour guide was entertaining and the time flew by as he explained the life in Kolmanskop in its heyday. He didn't provide a huge amount of depth but he made us laugh and we enjoyed it thoroughly. We then spent the next two hours wandering through the  dilapidated buildings by ourselves, up to the swimming pool, and through the museum. We are sorry we didn't visit the married couples houses - they looked boring - because we found out a few days later from others that the interiors were very interesting with different colours painted on the walls. Reviews say the curio shop is good but I wouldn't agree. It's the same stuff you find anywhere and not particularly inspiring. We had a nice coffee at the cafe, and what's fascinating is that the cafe appears to be the same as it was in the 1910's judging from the photos on the wall. Just a note on the buildings - I am sure if this were in America, you'd not be allowed in the buildings cos they look like they're about the cave in! But there are no areas cordoned off, and while you are warned it is entry at your own risk, it is quite scary! But we went up sloping staircases and were glad to see all the nooks and crannies. Regarding footwear, I am glad I wore slip slops cos this is all about sand and my shoes would've been heavy with sand had I walked around in them.",25-Apr-14,Couples,Epupa Falls

Give yourself time to just be here and experience the beauty. When we arrived it was full of people, noisy. But after about an hour it emptied out and we loved the tranquility of the place.

Udi S,"Maui, HI","Picturesque, but spooky â adds to your perspective of Namibia's legacy","Stately buildings descending into ruin are always a fascinating sight. Kolmanskop has 'em! I enjoyed the picturesque decay; my wife saw it as gloomy, but still appreciated visiting. While you're free to walk around, I highly recommend taking the guided tour (starting at 9:30 and 11:00 a.m. when we were there in July). The tour is free, although you should tip your guide, and adds valuable perspective on the forces that shaped Namibia's history. You understand how Europeans came in, recognized an untapped resource, and exploited the hell out of it while leaving a minimum for the locals. Another review advises you to arrive early to photograph without the crowds, but it was easy enough to just wait until people had moved on. Do it only if you want that early morning light.",5-Aug-19,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole
Udi S,"Maui, HI",High quality items at surprisingly reasonable ... FIXED ... prices,"Saved the Craft Centre for the end of our trip because I assumed the fixed pricing would translate to a tourist-trap rip-off and I'd do better haggling in roadside stands. I was wrong.  While it has a smaller, more curated selection, the merchandise quality was higher and the prices lower than what we haggled for in the countryside. (Although you could argue that the countryside people are needier â rich tourists haggling in poor countries is always a quandary.) A pleasant shopping center with its own secure parking lot. Credit cards accepted for most larger purchases.",8-Aug-19,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp
UK,UK,The whole experience has the WOW effect!,"We left from Frans Indongo Lodge at about 6:30am and arrived at the Cheetah Conservation Fund at about 2hrs later. The last part of the ride have very interesting scenery. The Cheetah Conservation Fund has immaculate grounds and buildings. The museum tour with our wonderful guide after seeing the Cheetahs was very interesting and covered a lot of aspects of the cheetah itself and other factors that area around the cheetah such as people, other animals etc. The most interesting fact that the guide brought up was that the cheetahs were not being killed for skins as most people think, they are being shot by the farmers because the cheetah kills their goats which the farmer get a large amount of money for their goats. So the Fund is giving the farmers a dog that will protect the goats and keep the cheetahs alive. But the highlight of the tour was to go out in an enclosure with the cheetahs who are being exercised to keep them fit like they would in the wild. The guides for this were very good at explaining what we should do and not do. There were 7 of us on the tour. We all had to stand close to each other because to the cheetah, we looked like a herd! The cheetah had to catch a rag that was on a wire moving very fast since the cheetahs can go up to50mph, if I remember correctly. When the cheetah gets a rag, they get a piece of meat. I stood next to the man who gave them the meat. The cheetah took it and went a few feet from us and ate his reward. You just can't explain the feeling to be so close to the cheetahs. We also ate at the facility. The coffee was great, the home made goats cheese and everyone was very helpful. Nice restrooms also. I can't say enough about this facility.",4-Sep-13,Couples,Onguma Bush Camp

ukrandomtraveller,uk,George of Namibia is the best,"I would highly recommend wild wind safaris to organise a bespoke tour. We stayed 9 nights with a private guide and car...in our opinion well worth the extra money as we got to see so much more than if we had been driving ourselves.so the organisation by Phillip was top class....he was always quick to communicate and happy to add in anything we wanted to do.....we did a 'traditional' route...the desert swakopmund damaraland and etosha.....but we opted to take a private flight from the desert to swakopmund, firstly to cut out one of the drives..and secondly it was an amazing experience!Our guide George was the best. He was like a walking encyclopedia....and his eyes could spot wildlife at huge distances...we would have missed so much without him. He had a great sense of humour and we really enjoyed his company.If you are travelling to Namibia ask for George!wild wind safaris chose our hotels...we loved the 1st 3....though the 4th etosha village at the end was on the spartan side...the main issue was that the dining was only available in open sided huts.....and as it was winter it was 5-7 degrees in the morning and perhaps 12-15 in the evening. Dressing for dinner involved donning multiple layers and not dressing up! so I would suggest reading up on the hotels and the likely temperatures  before agreeing to them.all in all though an amazing trip and thank you to the wild wind safari team",20-Jun-22,Friends,Namutoni

Uppsala,"Uppsala, Sweden",Overrated place with an unclear philosophy,We stopped overnight in Otjiwarongo partly because we had heard about the cheetahs and got interested. The visit - with the cheetah drive - was disappointing. The guide was not very knowledgeable and the aim of the foundation seemed unclear and probably (in relation to recent legislation and developments in Namibia) obsolete. There were a few adult and some real old cheetahs in enclosures to see - that was all. Hardly worth the almost 100 km drive back and forth from Otjiwarongo and the rather expensive price (almost 500 ZAR pp).

Not sure if I would make a major effort to get there early in the morning as the site is beautiful anytime of the day.  Had a 4WD (Toyota Fortuner, which doesn't have the greatest clearance) and was able to navigate (barely) the final section to Deadvlei but it is not an easy passage.  The sand is quite deep in places and we saw a number of folks get stuck.  You will need to keep your speed up and maybe deflate your tires though how you reinflate them might be problematic.  In retrospect, taking the shuttle might be a better option.Climbing the dunes can be a bit strenuous if you are over 40 so I would go easy as medical help is a long way off.

For instance she arranged a stay at a chalet in Etosha that was nonpareil for convenience and comfort as well as my photographic interests. Some stops in our 21-day self-drive trip were necessitated by the need to be assured of an adequate fuel supply. The self-drive aspect of our trip was met with an excellent vehicle, and great planning and support.

Vincenzo D,"Pescara, Italy","Beautiful tour for the places, but also for the perfect organization","For our trip to Namibia we relied on TripAdvisor, and we chose the tour operator with the best reviews, Wild Wind Safaris.  It was a great idea, because we spent a perfect holiday, both for the established itinerary and for the guide who accompanied us, the nice George, and for the car made available, a new and comfortable Ford Ranger, both for the hotels where we stayed.  The tour included stays in Sossusvlei, Swakopmund and Etosha National Park.  In the first stage we stayed at the Agama Lodge, a brand new Lodge animated by the presence of friendly warthogs, who came up to the poolside to receive something to eat, with a breathtaking view of the desert.  The trips were organized by George, who proved to be an expert connoisseur of the whole desert area, making us discover the most beautiful corners and giving us information on all the fauna and flora present.  The second stop, in Swakopmund, is the one where the only critical issue arose, as the hotel room, the Stay @ Swakop, was not to our liking.  Philip, the tour operator, immediately activated from Windhoek and arranged for us to change the room, obtaining a much larger and better located one.  It is possible that something is not right on a trip, this is normal, and for this reason it is even more important to know that you have a tour operator ready to intervene.  In Swakop we went on tours with local operators, always recommended by George, with boat and off-road trips on the desert dunes, both of which must be done absolutely.  Finally we went to Etosha National Park, where we stayed in another very beautiful Lodge, the Toshari Lodge, and we went to discover the park together with the tireless George, a connoisseur of the most hidden corners of the park.  Thanks to him we were able to see all the animals present, including the rare rhinos, and the families of lions, which we were able to meet only by going at dawn.  Finally, I would like to underline that the cost of the tour seemed very honest to me, because the two Lodges are very beautiful, the off-road vehicle was comfortable and new, the guide George very competent, all travel expenses were also included in the price, entrance tickets to the various parks, dinners in excellent restaurants.

We opt for the shortcut whilst the others go for the ridge at 100mtres high to then slide down into Deadvlei.  It is early morning - our climb starts at 9.15am and it is end April - there is no wind.We do the first part in 10 minutes with trainers.  The next part is very challenging - soft sand with our feet sinking in, so I take off my shoes and climb in my socks and like a monkey on all fours.  This part takes 20 minutes.  Once on the ridge of this part, I put on my shoes again and continue the climb which actually I did not find too difficult.  I reached the summit in 45 minutes, stopping to take photos of the magnificent scenery on both sides of the Dune.  I therefore could have reached the top faster.  Honestly, when I read the reviews of Dune 45 and all the hoo ha I now realise either how fit I am or how unfit everyone else is.",13-May-18,Friends,Namutoni
VirginiaTraveler805,"Richmond, VA",Magnificent to photograph or climb,"As for me, I took the easier route of photographing those climbing the dune and instead chose to hike to the adjacent salt pan, Deadvlei. The dune is nothing short of massive. According to our guide, approximately 2+ hours may be required to summit the dune and 40 minutes to descend. Some take the route of rolling down the side of the dune rather than walking down.",6-Aug-17,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole
VirginiaTraveler805,"Richmond, VA",Absolutely spectacular! A not-to-be-missed site!,"My main reason for visiting Namibia was to photograph Deadvlei, and it did not disappoint!  It was indeed the highlight of my two week long visit to Namibia. Although this magnificent salt pan is located adjacent to Big Daddy Dune, one does not need to summit the dune to reach Deadvlei. With that said, one does need to hike from the parking lot through shifting sand for approximately 20 to 30 minutes to reach the salt pan. Be sure to take plenty of water with you. Upon completing the hike, the salt plan will open before you and you will witness a wide array of trees that have been dead for more than 600 years. This is in fact a photographers paradise. One should be aware that the light changes dramatically and quickly throughout the day. While in the salt pan, be sure to photograph those climbing Big Daddy Dune. As one enters the salt pan, there is a large log where many of the guides wait and where hikers can rest. Be aware that there is little to no shade available. For those wishing not to hike to Deadvlei, there are picnic tables immediately adjacent to the parking lot where one can rest and wait for companions to return.",6-Aug-17,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole

Werner Wanderlust,"Cape Town, South Africa",Grabbing a cab out into the desert? read here How to do it,"Unlike most travelers in Namibia, we did not have our own transport and had to rely on public transport, the taxi/cabs with numbers on the side. The cabs come in all shapes and sizes and are recognisable by the numbers on the side of the vehicle or most of the time they will honk at you if they have space available. Please note, they take as many passengers as they can in the vehicle, often stopping to pick someone else up along route, while the fares are per person. Generally speaking, travelling anywhere within Walvis Bay costs N$24 per person. Travelling to Swakopmund, 43km / 40min costs N$45 per person. The cab drivers have no meters, so be sure to negotiate the price of the trip before getting in and obviously they will try and rip off tourists, but if you let them know that you know what the locals pay and will rather use another taxi, they will take you for the local price. Getting to Dune 7 and back we each paid N$50 for the return ride. We had bought a Namibian Sim card, so could just call our driver from the Dune when we were done, to come and fetch us. by this time we had saved at least two different drivers' numbers in case one of them was busy.So, apart from the Cab fare, visiting Dune 7 is FREE! well, we went to the free picnic area at the base of the dune. There is an activity centre close by ,but we opted for the free experience. We arrived around 11 am and it was still very misty/foggy, which was great for climbing the big dune, as I can just imagine how gruelling it must be in the heat of the sun.

Willem A,"Cape Town, South Africa",Visiting and climbing at Spitzkoppe - The Matterhorn of Africa,"I was working in Namibia for a week and had some spare time so we (a friend and I) decided to rent a car in Windhoek and drive to Spitzkoppe to see it and to get in some granite climbing in.Firstly, the campsites are BASIC, an open/clear spot and that is that. Take your own water, wood, etc.We literally had nothing, but managed to scrounge up a 20L Jerry can and some cups form a friend, so there we were, 2 guys, a car, some food in plastic bags, a jerrycan full of water and 2 tin cups.When we were there, March 2013, there was a new manager.  He was super nice and helpful. However they were not climbers, and we found extremely little beta on the routes.  If you are going there for climbing, GET A GUIDEBOOK IN ADVANCE, they have a very basic topo of the main ascent route, and that is it.  We tried getting a guidebook in Windhoek before we went, but had no luck (actually we spent an entire day going to each and every bookshop in Windhoek).That being said, they did have showers at the entrance of the camp (not at the actual camp sites), and the best of wall, a bar selling COLD beers, always a luxury when traveling in Africa and a big plus.The climbing is desperate slab climbing, and most routes are under graded.  Also, we went in summer, making it hard to climb as it got super hot.We did manage to visit some of the caves, and do some hiking around the area as well.  This was super nice, and was really special.  I don't easily feel the ""energy"" of a place, but here, I could clearly feel the ""energy"" or at least felt that this was and still is a great place.  It was also, at one time, the stronghold of a group of original inhabitants of Namibia, and you can really feel it, when you are alone in this majestic place.  When it is very quiet, you can here the voices from the past reaching out to you, clawing to life in this oasis, in the desert silence.

Worcesteriet,"Worcester, South Africa",Kolmanskop,Really enjoyed this visit with our 10year old daughter. Took the tour with William. Staff are very friendly and well informed. They are eager to show off the site. Sad to see the vandalism-we also visited 16 years ago. Shocking grafiti on the walls in the hospital. Were really upset that supposedly educated people can come visit from Europe(they are not ashamed to add their name and country to their scribbles) and think it is appropriate to draw pictures with a permanent marker on the wall of a historic landmark. I got to the conclusion that they carry a permanent marker with them for just this purpose. Try to make it for the first tour-you will miss most of the wind! Remember to take a lightweight scarf or buff to pull over your nose and mouth if the wind does come up. It helps keep the very fine dustparticles out. Sunglasses for outside.

It would be probably better if this place would be left on its own. Beware of the lodge drivers: for the last 4 km you needs a 4WD and since most tourists have one they attempt to drive themselves. However, driving in sand needs to be practiced (lower your tire pressure and keep a good speed, at least 40 km) and the lodge drivers take advantage of this. They stop their Landies at ""strategic places"" so you need to slow down or stop and you will certainly get stuck. Then they ""offer"" help, get your car out and ""offer"" at the same time to go with them, an offer most accept. Cost you of course 10 $ per person.

We took a taxi here and the craft centre cafÃ© was kind enough to call us a taxi when we were finished.  We decided to have lunch first after reading the good reviews about the cafÃ©.  The service was good and we didnât have to wait too long for our food.  I had a sandwich and it was definitely big enough for 2 people.  The desserts looked good, but I didnât have any room left after eating such a massive sandwich.  After eating lunch, we spent a couple of hours shopping.  This place is fairly large so I do recommend spending a couple hours here if you are looking to purchase some nice souvenirs.  All of the prices are fixed, but reasonable.  They have a wide variety of souvenirs, ranging from wood carvings to stuffed toy animals to baskets.  I wished that I had more time than 2 hours to go shopping!  Overall it was an excellent place to go souvenir shopping and eat lunch.

worldtraveller2801,"Chula Vista, CA",Excellent tour,"Myself and 3 friends only had time to take a half day tour with Wild Wind Safaris.  I contacted them about the half day Ancient San Bushmen Ethnic Experience and they were very quick to respond back.  They provided me with the details of the tour, the cost, and times.  They were very flexible because initially it was only going to be 3 of us, then a couple days before another friend wanted to join the tour.  They said that it wasnât a problem to add the 4th person.  They picked us up at Penduka, which was a slightly extra cost because of the distance then dropped us off at a hotel in downtown Windhoek.  On the day of the tour, the guide called Penduka to let us know he was on his way and picked us up at the designated time.  It took about an hour to drive to the N/aâan ku se Lodge where the San Bushmen tour took place.  A guide from the lodge joined us and we drove in a safari type vehicle for about 15 minutes.  The drive there was basically a short game drive because we saw many wild animals including baboons, ostrich, and giraffes.  The Lodge supports the San people and their traditional cultures.  They had a small village set up for the tourists to visit.  There were 2 men, 3 women, and a baby present to show us their traditional skills such as fire making.  A couple of the women were working on beaded necklaces when we arrived.  They had some necklaces for sale at a reasonable price.  We went on a walk with them and they showed us many different types of plants that they use for food and medicine.  The guide with us translated for us so we were able to ask them questions.  The tour was great and the San people were very kind and interesting to listen to.  N/aâan ku se Lodge is close to the airport so you could potentially take this tour then have the guide drop you off at the airport for an afternoon flight.  Overall, I highly recommend Wild Wind Safaris and would like to take a tour with them again if I ever visit Namibia.",30-Aug-16,Friends,Namib-Naukluft National Park

The shorter of the two guides walks offered is supposed to last 45 minutes and the longer walk an hour and a half. However, since we are reasonably fit ans used to walking we asked the guide to speed things up since there were only two of us on her tour and we were pressed for time. accordingly, managed to complete the longer guided tour in just over an hour.

WorldwideAtraveller,"Beauvais, France","Two Week Namibia Self-drive holiday - excellent bookings, assistance and service","We used the services of Namibia Tours and Safaris for the planning and logistical arrangements for a classic self-drive trip around Central (as far North as Etosha) and Southern Namibia, with the addition of a three-day detour into South Africa to visit the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.; and on a number of occasions we specified which type of accommodation we would like to stay in.Our agent, Ulrike, was always helpful and replied promptly to our mails. We first contacted her about 9 months before our holiday, and everything was booked and confirmed more than six months before we started our trip. All of our accommodations met our expectations and on a couple of occasions we were pleased to discover that our accommodations had been upgraded at no extra cost and without our requesting this.The holiday itself went off perfectly, without any hitches. Upon our arrival at Windhoek International Airport, we were as pre-arranged transferred to our first night's accommodation and were authorised to already make use of our hire vehicle - which was awaiting us at the guesthouse - that evening, although the official hand-over procedure and explanation of the 4x4 was only scheduled for first thing the following morning. The next day Wayne from Namibia Tours and Safaris was there on time and thoroughly explained the vehicle to us. It was particularly reassuring to be informed that the vehicle was satellite-tracked, and that they would be monitoring our progress and would be able to intervene if necessary. It was also reassuring to know that the vehicle was equipped with two spare tyres - the gravel roads are often fairly bad in Namibia and punctures are common - and that since we were insured for tyres, if we needed to have any replaced the agency would reimburse us. Luckily we did not need to change any tyres. Following the handover of our vehicle, Estelle from Namibia Tours and Safaris provided us with all the necessary documentation and vouchers for our trip, and gave us a number of additional, useful tips to make our trip more agreeable. Estelle also transmitted a couple of request to our agent, Ulrike, for additional excursions, and Ulrike followed up on these requests for us immediately.

Yann D,"Shanghai, China",Unforgettable honeymoon in Namibia,"My wife and I just came back from a 18 days guided tour for our honeymoon. The first contact with Namibia Tours & Safaris was last November and until our departure to Namibia on April 5, we had regular contacts with Kady Bernstein to organize the whole tour. Kady was of excellent advice and took into account all our expectations to organize our trip, from the best places to visit in Namibia to the lodges/hotels to stay. We only had a few adjustments to make, mostly due to time constraints and everything was well planified before we landed. Once we arrived in Windhoek, we were greeted by our guide Jurgens with whom we spent our 18 day trip. This was a wonderful journey around the whole country: Kalahari desert, Fish River Canyon, LÃ¼deritz area, Wolwedans, Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, the Skeleton Coast, Damaraland, Opuwo and Etosha park... Jurgens was the best guide and made our trip so successful! We also spent lots of time all together discussing during dinners, in the end it was like travelling with a friend.The places we stayed were also all amazing with excellent service, except in Sossusvlei as we stayed at a NWR lodge (national owned) which service is not as the same level as in the private owned lodges, but at least we were in the national park thus able to leave very early to climb on top of the Dune Big Daddy.As for the food, we would definitely recommend Namibia for all those who look for excellent meat (vegetarians may have a hard time there!).In conclusion, there was always a new place to discover and the whole trip went very well.

Unfortunately we only had one night - spend at least two, if you can. We had to drag ourselves away in the morning from the ever changing herds of animals that just kept on arriving.Silence is essential and magical. The good thing is, most people understand the importance of being absolutely quiet. There will always be a few who don't so maybe the waterhole should have a sign requesting silence, like the one at Halali. I would also question bringing very young children along, unless they are able to be quiet for a reasonable length of time.This waterhole, and indeed the whole of Etosha is just out of this world.

At that point I really wondered why anyone would have wanted to stay there in the first place - apart from the diamonds of course. Anyway, the next morning the weather was perfect and we did the tour that was offered. I found this incredibly informative and interesting. I loved the homes and buildings that must have been photographed 1000's of times - and I think each picture must be different with the continuous movement of the sand and the changing light. One of the houses stood out more than the others to me - it would be a ""renovators dream"" were the circumstances different. Beautiful room sizes with a bay window balcony upstairs - couldn't help but wonder about the families that lived there and what kind of life they had.

yycyycyyc,"Calgary, AB",Matterhorn of Africa,"Heat haze permitting, Spitzkoppe is visible across the semi-desert from over 100km away, and from one angle, does indeed look like the Matterhorn. As you approach, what appeared as a single mountain splits into two, with several smaller lumps. They are all a kind of pink granite which erodes fairly easily so you can follow ""trails"" of paler rock in some places. Grip is good enough to make clambering secure.Some parts can only be accessed with a guide, but the main splendour can easily be appreciated yourself. We clambered up and around much of the area around the rock bridge, under whose arch the Pontok Mountains are framed -- the angle is wrong to see Spitzkoppe itself through the arch. There is a rock pool area nearby, somewhat spoilt by the addition of a concrete dam to try and maintain water, but the strong wind was still blowing the water out of it.If you're driving a 4WD, do circumnavigate the mountains for a completely different perspective -- and solitude -- on the northern side.We wished we'd had longer than 3 hours; ideally we'd have camped and seen either the sunset or sunrise (or both!) -- it must be incredible with the pink rock.",17-May-17,Couples,Desert Explores

And of course it is hot: 40C on the day we went; over 50C is what the guides would call hot.So while it is a physical challenge, the carvings are amazing. Our guide provided information, but was not excited nor passionate about them, which was disappointing.

yycyycyyc,"Calgary, AB",Truly Awesome Experience,"TAKE LOTS OF WATER, at least 2 litres each. Walking up sand dunes is hard work, doubly so in 40C heat. We drove our 4x4 to the end of the paved road, and were recommended to take the shuttle the last 5km to the starting point of the Big Daddy and Deadvlei walks. We could have driven ourselves.We wore hats and long sleeves to combat the strong sun and heat. The first part was generally flat, and easier on the sections of grey, dried mud flats. Then up the sand ridge to the left of Deadvlei. The more people who walk there, the more compact the footsteps become, and the easier it is as you slide back less. But the higher you go, the more difficult it becomes as more and more people go down into Deadvlei. Also, scale is hard to determine, as all you can see above you is sand. At one of my many stops I thought it would be 100 more steps to the summit. It took 325.But the views from the top are stunning in all directions; well worth the effort. What did surprise me was the life. Lots of wee beetles, many green, small lizards that burrowed into the sand or scurried down the slope as I approached, and swallows swooping, so there must have been insects for them to eat.

The mosquito net had been repaired using band-aids, our bathroom window was cracked, the room wasn't dirty but it was poorly maintained. It wasn't until I asked if we could fill our water bottle that I was informed the water was not safe to drink (everywhere else we stayed in Namibia is ok to drink tap water and if not, it is clearly indicated next to the taps and at check in).Overall, the entire complex is over commercialised, needs to reassess its recruitment and staff training strategy and is in dire need of a revamp.

But unlike equivalent areas in the Red Rock country in the southwest of the US, the stone here is a dull grey in colour and there is almost no vegetation along the canyon rim making for very monotone views. I'm sure the stone colours nicely at sunset, but the park closes so early at this time of year that you have to leave while the sun was still high in the sky. Yes, Fish River Canyon is worth a visit if you are in southern Namibia, but don't expect to be overwhelmed if you have been to Utah, Arizona or Colorado.",9-Nov-14,Couples,Okaukuejo waterhole

OphirB,Israel,To be honest.... Disappointing,"Yes, the view is amazing at first. A big deep canyon carving its way throuhg the desert. But this is exactly where it stopps. The river is almost completetly dried up. There is no way you can climb down, as they closed the area for hikers. So there's really not much to do there, except for possibly drive up to another viewpoint a short distance further. This was even more disappointing since it was our last attraction and special visiting spot in Namibia. Luckily the way towards the Fish River canyon took us along the surprising and amazing Oranje River, which forms the border between Namibia and South-Africa.After several hours of driving in full desert landscape, the scene of driving next to an intensively flowing river, with all its greenary inside and outside - was positively shocking. The river also contained many small rocky islands with versatile shapes and forms. It seemed like this would be the perfect spot for crocodiles, but other than that, it was so inviting to jump in and refresh yourself.",10-Aug-17,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole

It is not advisible to travel this road on your own. Stay with other cars in case your car breaks down. There is no assistents on this road. On the return trip use the road to Grunau  about 110km from the canyon view point, this road is not to bad but sandy and a lonely road.",10-Feb-14,Couples,Swakopmund Museum

Rose M,Angola,"Disappointing, badly managed place & missed potential","Unfortunately what could be a really neat place has clearly been badly mismanaged.  The place was completely empty as they closed the pool and restaurant, so the only thing to do is the game drive. It was a nice little road and we did see a few animals, which is the only thing we can recommend when visiting this place. We then did the long walking trail which the ranger at reception advised, but it turned out to be a really rough experience. The trail is poorly marked; there are no sign posts with information or mileage, no shade anywhere for resting at the occasional benches, no water features or animals to be seen. The first part is alright through the hills, but then the second half is along a riverbed with nothing to see and the end is a sudden steep uphill. At the end we commented how we didn't see anything and it was so hot even at 9-10am, and the ranger said of course it's too hot to see animals - but when I asked why she recommended we do the trail then she didn't have an answer. If you only have a weekend like we did and you just want to spend time in nature then this can be nice, but keep your expectations low and bring lots of water with you.",23-Mar-17,Solo,Okaukuejo waterhole
Dan J,"Charlottesville, Virginia, United States",Not a reserve for solo travelers!,"I love to hike and I was looking forward to a day of hiking at Daan Viljoen. I had read about their 9km loop trail and restaurant and imagined I would do the trail then eat at the restaurant. But after arriving at the gate I was told the restaurant has been closed since the beginning of COVID. Of course I continued and next stopped at reception. But there I was told I wouldn't be allowed to do the 9km hiking trail as a solo hiker. I asked why and they said it was too dangerous and said I could do the 1.5km trail (one-way) instead. I couldn't believe it. I asked what made it dangerous and was told some hiker was bitten by a snake and couldn't get help. I mean, OK, but that can happen anywhere. There are dangers just about everywhere people hike. I asked him to elaborate on what snakes are at the reserve, but he only said ""all kinds"", apparently not able to name any even though he had just warned me about them. So I started on the 1.5km trail, which I have to say is very poorly marked. There are only the occasional arrows painted in yellow on rocks, or thin meter-high poles painted in yellow. Yellow happens to blend in with the surrounding yellowish grass, so not a very smart color. This isn't serious complaint because the trail follows the dry river bed so it's impossible to get lost. The trail was nice, but very short and possibly not worth the trip to Daan Viljoen for any solo travelers.",23-May-23,Solo,Onguma Bush Camp

We try d to contact the park security and told him that we could not sleep with all that noise. He tried to talk to the restaurant but it had no effect. The day after we complained to the manager of the area about what happened the night before. The only thing we got was a silly lough and a lame excuse, no understand that we had only 4 hours of sleep and no compensation whatsoever. We spend a lot of money to be there, itâs a very expensive place to be and you have to sign an formular with a lot of rules you had to apply. One of them was not playing music at any time or disturbing other guest. But they did whatever the wanted, so if you want to sleep at a disco go there, if not donât go there. Trust me!

Mounthutt,Leeds,Slightly disconsolate feel,"Visited Daan Viljoen nature reserve in July with my wife. Situated about 20km to the West of Windhoek, clearly sign posted from the City centre and one straight road through. Upon arrival you are met at the gates by a member of staff who takes your details and hands you a letter with the park rules and regulations. You then drive a further 4km to the park office where you pay the entrance fee (N$40 per person + N$10 per vehicle - approximately Â£4.50 for two people). Unfortunately the office had no maps so it wasn't very clear where you could go or what there was to see. We did however find a sign post indicating the start of a hike but the trail wasn't well marked and after 20 minutes or so walking we had lost all semblance of a route and we're just using landmarks to navigate. Despite the lack of direction, the walk was enjoyable and we saw 2 ostriches, numerous warthogs and a variety of antelope. We didn't eat in the restaurant by the pool so can't comment on the food. Driving around the accommodation area etc. looked clean and tidy but it had an 'air' of desolation about it. On the drive out we stumbled across the 6.5km self drive safari route (4x4's only) which was enjoyable but we only managed to see a few antelopes right at the very end.

jbusse2015,United Kingdom,Dissapointment!,"We spent the past weekend, 27 and 28 February 2015 at the ""luxury chalets"" and were reasonably disappointed with our ""mid-term"" break.  The chalets were neat. They should however rather be advertised as free-standing hotel rooms with a bar fridge and a few plates etc.  The rooms are aimed more at overnight couples than families who are wanting to enjoy a self-catering  experience.  It is one large room with an outside basin and braai and no cooking utensils.Although we were 2 adults and two young children we could cope with this as I packed extra plates, cups and utensils for my kids.A further disappointment of the weekend was that we wanted to enjoy the wildlife and relax at the pool with our children. However, the day visitors who arrive in large numbers seem to take preference over the people who are paying to stay at a ""luxury chalet"" and they seem to occupy  the entire pool area,  all the umbrellas and sun loungers.  It is more like a public pool than a luxury ""lodge"" experience.We opted to visit around the fire at our ""chalet"" in the evening and enjoy the company of the animals. The visitors to the pool area and Boma restaurant were however quite rowdy and having  a loud party on the Saturday evening so no animals were sighted!Baboons at the chalets are quite a problem in the evenings and mornings. There behaviour is quite brazen as they move from chalet  to chalet tipping bins and looking for food. Whilst this is not the fault of the resort we do however feel that this should be controlled or addressed by the staff.  The safety of young children could be threatened.The last issue was the very disappointing shop or kiosk.  We looked on the website before going to Daan Viljoen and saw that they have a kiosk that sells meat, wood, charcoal and necessities for the weekend. Upon visiting the kiosk we could not believe how empty the shelves were. We did not see any meat, briquettes or anything of interest such as tourist items. It is such a shame, as this  being a major tourist attraction, you would have thought you would be able to purchase a cap, t-shirt or something Namibian from there.Sorry, but we will not be returning to Daan Viljoen in the near future!J.Busse",30-Apr-19,Family,Etosha_Pan

The restaurant has been moved to the pool area and access to the location of the old restaurant at the dam wall is blocked off. The pool area is lovely and reasonably well maintained. The new restaurant is a huge thatch roofed venue that could sear at least 100 or possibly more guests.  The service in the restaurant was very friendly and the food was good.  However it took over an hour to serve our starters and the snails we ordered were like warm when they finally arrived. the main course dishes were very tasty and we all enjoyed the food.The chalets have been renovated and look fantastic. However there appears to be much more work needed to bring this reserve back up to the standard needed to attract visitors.  There appears to be a general lack of maintenance in some parts.  The drought has certainly taken its toll, but newly planted trees appear to not be being watered, so the are dying also.The bathroom facilities at the restaurant have been beautifully refurbished, but again some basic housekeeping appears to be lacking and the facilities seemed to be superficially cleaned.Overall, we had mixed feelings about this place.

Great for a couple of hours of birding.",31-Aug-16,Business,Okaukuejo waterhole
John R,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",The Daan Viljoen nature has been turned into a very modern tasteless housing development.,"It was like visiting a typical security estate. quite fancy modern architecture (the hotel group who have taken it over must be spending a lot and sadly not well) We were the only guests for lunch in a vast, really huge thatch room/hall. A couple of baboons lurked near some domestic horses which were wandering about.On a previous visit in 1986 the birding was wonderful and the thatched chalets and small restaurant were charming.In a word - avoid.",31-Dec-15,Couples,Epupa Falls
Apaties,"Windhoek, United Kingdom",The Worst Lunch Buffet in Namibia,"Our family booked the Sunday buffet.  It was the worst buffet that we ever had.  There was no variety in the food.  The meat was overcooked.  There was only one type of vegetable and the desert was stale.  It appeared as if the staff were hiding the food at the back of the kitchen as to allow them to take it home.  The meal was further way overpriced.  The service was pathetic, we had to walk up to the waiter in order to get drinks.  When the bill came, an additional park fee was levied to the bill.  To top of a horrible meal the waiter disappeared with our change.  DO NOT GO HERE",31-Dec-16,Friends,Spitzkoppe
Marius Schoeman,"Centurion, South Africa",Give them a try,I stayed for 2 nights on business trip. Very nice upgraded accommodation including stunning camp sites. Problems re gate been addressed by management as you can only exit at 18:00 which was previously opened by Game Rangers. Hotel now have key to ensure gate is opened for guests who need to leave early. If you only sleep over you don't need permit to drive around - as long as you stay on tar road to hotel. Restaurant was disappointing. Nice conference venues,31-Dec-16,Business,Namib Desert
DOSIMAN,Jaipur,Dissapointed,"Could not see any animals . The drive is not suited for cars , must have 4 -wheel drive vehicle . The reception at the office informed that we can go in car for game viewing . The office is far from gate for park fees payment . From office ,one has to return back almost to the agte and then begin game viewing . Office could have been located at gate , avoiding all the hassle . presnt office can be coverted to another  restaurent / resting place",31-Jan-16,Solo,Spitzkoppe
Charmaine S,"Johannesburg, South Africa",5 Star facilities - 3 star service,"10 out of 10 for decor, finishings and character of the lodge.  Being newly renovated it is absolutely fantastic.  Unfortunately the service does not match the expecations.  Staff poorly trained and limited experience in restaurant / conference management.  The chef had some wonderful moments, and then other times missed the boat a little.  Not sure I would go back unless the service is drastically improved, which is a pity considering the luxurious finishings and decor. View is also to die for!",31-Jul-16,Business,Waterberg National Park
Sonja V,United Kingdom,"San Karos - Poor food, terrible service","We went here on a Sunday for coffee and cake. The restaurant looks very nice. We ordered coffee and the only type of cake they had. We had to wait for almost an hour for our coffee. When the waiter finally brought our coffee, the one cup was only a quarter full, because according to him the perculator was now empty. Our cake was so old, we couldn't get the spoon through it and had to stab it with a knife to brake pieces off. I don't know how their main meals are, but will never ever go there again for cake and coffee. Not worth the trip and money.",31-Mar-16,Friends,Okaukuejo waterhole
